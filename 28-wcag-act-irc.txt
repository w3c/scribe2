<KarenHerr> Wilco: all approvals, can go in
<KarenHerr> RESOLUTION: Accept language input aspect update
<KarenHerr> zakim, take up next
<Zakim> agendum 2 -- Follow-up on First attempt at defining implementations -- taken up [from Wilco]
<Wilco> https://github.com/w3c/wcag-act/pull/522/files
<KarenHerr> Wilco: ok with everyone to review on the pull request?
<KarenHerr> trevor: if we do all the editing on github and then do survey.   is it all cfc then?
<KarenHerr> Wilco: it would be cfc.
<kathyeng> jennifer: minimal category is ok
<kathyeng> daniel: not opposed to "minimal" term
<kathyeng> wilco: there is an implementor who wants the minimal category
<KarenHerr> JennC: Minimal category is ok
<KarenHerr> dmontalvo: not opposed to "minimal" term
<KarenHerr> Wilco: here is an implementor who wants the minimal category
<KarenHerr> Wilco: what to do with approved and proposed rules with implementation
<KarenHerr> kathyeng: makes sense that approved rules would show list of implementations. where it says "may", we don't currently list any of them.
<KarenHerr> kathyeng: when we are proposing a rule - we need at least one implementation to get to approved.  when it's approved, we're not listing the implementations that got us to "approved"?
<KarenHerr> Wilco: I think we are.  but we don't do it for previous versions
<KarenHerr> Wilco: doesn't seem useful.  just look at latest version
<KarenHerr> Wilco: in our policy, we need a complete implementation
<KarenHerr> Wilco: before we send it to AG
<KarenHerr> kathyeng: are we keeping  history somewhere?
<KarenHerr> Wilco: no
<KarenHerr> kathyeng: would be useful to have background
<KarenHerr> Wilco: github has history, do we need more?  do we want that level of detail
<KarenHerr> kathyeng: make sense to have implementation section for rules moving forward, at least implementations that got the rule approvied
<KarenHerr> Wilco: section already exists, but is different from changes
<KarenHerr> Wilco: do the implementations need to report the accessibility requirements?
<KarenHerr> Wilco: for example, my tool reports a rule as a best practice, where ACT says it's a violation of WCAG.  is that a rule we want to say is consistent?
<KarenHerr> kathyeng: in one way, it is recording the issue
<KarenHerr> Wilco: do we want to enforce in some way that an implementation reports in a consistent way to what the rule says?  we haven't so far
<KarenHerr> Wilco: as far as harmonization goes, it seems like something we should consider
<KarenHerr> Wilco: implementation tests image buttons in the same way they test buttons - it may not fail 1.1.1.
<KarenHerr> trevor: not as strong as failing a requirement.
<KarenHerr> Wilco: the big problem that's created from getting this wrong, is that the numbers can look quite different.
<KarenHerr> Wilco: if tool a reports a criteria under one , but tool b reports it under several.
<KarenHerr> Wilco: message from mike gower at ibm. considering adding only success criteria to each issue
<KarenHerr> Wilco: can be confusing to see one fix solving more than one problem.
<trevor> 0
<KarenHerr> Wilco: poll - +1 if in favor of adding a requirement for consistent mapping for success criteria
<KarenHerr> +1
<kathyeng> +1
<dmontalvo> +1
<KarenHerr> Wilco: we need the implementors to be on board with what it means to be consistent
<KarenHerr> Wilco: follow up question - is that a thing we want to do for the highest level of consistency
<JennC> +1

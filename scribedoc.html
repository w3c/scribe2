  >Scribe.perl (link to the source)</a> is a perl script for
  generating meeting minutes
  from an IRC, IM or other log file that follows some simple minuting
  conventions. It is easy to use and requires no installation. It was
  primarily designed for use in and around W3C, but can also be used
  in other environments. (For use in other environments, see the <a
  href="#input_formats" >Input Formats</a> section.)

  <p>Scribe.perl supports <a href="#links"
   >links</a>, <a href="#images" >images</a>, <a href="#slides">slides</a>,
   <a href="#topic">subsections</a> and even <a href="#emphasis" >math</a>!

  <p>Some sample outputs: <a href="sample-public.html" >default
  style</a>, <a href="sample-member.html" >with option -member</a>, <a
  href="sample-team.html" >with option -team</a> and <a
  href="sample-fancy.html" >with option -fancy</a>.

  <p>This manual documents scribe.perl version 2, revision 238 (dated
  18 October 2024). See below for the <a href="#changes" >differences

  <h2 id="Pros_and_Cons_of_Using_Scribe.perl">Pros and Cons of Using
   Scribe.perl</h2>

  <p id=pros>Pros:

  <ul>
   <li>It's free, it's open source, and it usually works.

   <li>It runs anywhere that perl is installed. (I hope! Please let me
    know if it doesn't.)

   <li>Easy to use. It uses conventions that are used in many W3C
    working groups.

   <li>It recognizes several input and log formats.
  </ul>

  <p id=cons>Cons:

  <ul>
   <li>You still need to do some manual clean-up.

   <li>It doesn't recognize all minuting conventions. (Suggestion:
    Learn its conventions, they're simple.)
  </ul>


  <h2 id="running">Running scribe.perl</h2>

  <p>Scribe.perl reads from the files given as arguments, or standard
   input if there are none; and writes to standard output:

  <pre class="command">perl scribe.perl [options] &lt; log.txt &gt; minutes.html</pre>

  <p>It can also be <a
    href="https://www.w3.org/2002/03/RRSAgent#minutes" >invoked by
    RRSAgent</a> from IRC (provided you're using RRSAgent):</p>

  <pre class="command">rrsagent, draft minutes</pre>


  <h2 id="options">Options</h2>

  <p>Options described below are grouped in several categories:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><a href="#options_input_style" >Input Style Options</a>

   <li><a href="#options_output_format" >Output Format Options</a>

   <li><a href="#options_template" >Template Options</a>

   <li><a href="#options_scribe_identification" >Scribe Identification
     Options</a>

   <li><a href="#options_misc" >Miscellaneous Options</a>
  </ul>

  <p>There are three ways to specify options, from highest to lowest
   priority:

  <ul>
   <li>Using the ‘<a href="#command_scribeoptions"
    >ScribeOptions:</a>’ command in IRC

   <li>On the shell command line, when invoking scribe.perl

   <li>Via the <a href="#Environment_Variables">SCRIBEOPTIONS</a>
    environment variable
  </ul>

  <p>Options can be written with two dashes (‘--final’) or a single
   one (‘-final’) and they can be abbreviated as long as the
   abbreviation is unambiguous (‘--embedDiagnostics’ can be written
   ‘--embed’, but not ‘--em’, because that clashes with ‘--emphasis’).
   Case doesn't matter: ‘--dashTopics’ is the same as ‘--dashtopics’.

  <p>Options that require an argument can be separated from the
   argument with either a space or an equals sign: ‘--scribenick jvm’
   or ‘--scribenick=jvm’.

  <h3 id="options_input_style">Input Style Options</h3>

  <p>These options are used to accommodate the different input
   syntaxes and scribing styles.

  <dl>
  <dt id="dashTopics">-dashTopics

  <dd>
  <p>Indicate that dash lines are used to indicate that the next line
   is the start of a new topic, such as:

  <pre class="command">&lt;Philippe&gt; ---
&lt;Philippe&gt; Review of Action Items</pre>

  <p>instead of

  <pre class="command">&lt;Philippe&gt Topic: Review of Action Items</pre>


  <dt id="implicitContinuations">-implicitContinuations

  <dd>
  <p>Indicate that the scribe used implicit continuation lines like
   this:

  <pre class="command">&lt;dbooth&gt; Mary: Now is the time
&lt;dbooth&gt; for all good men and women
&lt;dbooth&gt; to come to the aid of their party.</pre>

  <p>instead of this:

  <pre class="command">&lt;dbooth&gt; Mary: Now is the time
&lt;dbooth&gt; ... for all good men and women
&lt;dbooth&gt; ... to come to the aid of their party.</pre>

  <p>The scribe can still add descriptive lines (lines not attributed
  to any speaker) by starting a line with a backslash
  (see <a href="#escaped" >‘Escaped’</a> below). E.g.:

<pre class="command">&lt;dbooth&gt; Mary: Now is the time
&lt;dbooth&gt; for all good men and women
&lt;dbooth&gt; to come to the aid of their party.
&lt;dbooth&gt; \Everybody agrees</pre>

  <p>This option <em>only</em> applies to text assigned to a speaker.
   To continue topics, resolutions, actions or issues on the next
   line, you must still use ‘...’ or ‘…’.

  <dt id=allowSpaceContinuations>-allowSpaceContinuations /
  -noallowSpaceContinuations

  <dd>
  <p>By default, scribe.perl removes leading spaces on a line and
   recognizes continuation lines because they start with three periods
   (‘...’) or an ellipsis (‘…’). <code>-allowSpaceContinuations</code>
   forces scribe.perl to treat lines that start with a space as
   continuation lines (if there is a line to continue), even if they
   don't start with ‘...’ For example, scribe.perl would normally
   interpret this fragment

  <pre class=command>&lt;jim-scribe&gt; Anna: Is the 5th OK?
&lt;jim-scribe&gt;  Silence.
&lt;jim-scribe&gt;  Jen: maybe</pre>

  <p>as three separate items: Anna saying ‘Is the 5th OK?’, the scribe
   giving a summary ‘Silence’ and Jen saying ‘maybe’. The extra spaces
   are ignored. With <code>-allowSpaceContinuations</code>, the three
   lines become a single statement attributed to Anna (‘Anna: Is the
   5th OK? Silence. Jen: maybe’)

  <p>The default is <code>-noallowSpaceContinuations</code>.

  <p>This option <em>only</em> applies to text assigned to a speaker.
   To continue topics, resolutions, actions or issues on the next
   line, you must still use ‘...’ or ‘…’.

  <dt id="useZakimTopics">-useZakimTopics

  <dd>
  <p>[Default] Recognize when Zakim bot is used to manage the agenda
   and the list of attendees.
   Specifically, treat Zakim statements like:

  <pre class="command">&lt;Zakim&gt; agendum 2. &quot;UTF16 PR issue&quot; taken up [from MSMscribe]</pre>

  <p>as equivalent to the command:

  <pre class="command">&lt;scribe&gt; Topic: UTF16 PR issue</pre>

  <p>and use Zakim's lines such as ‘As of this point the attendees
  were…’ as an additional source of names for the presence list.

  <dt id="noUseZakimTopics">-noUseZakimTopics

  <dd>
  <p>Turn off the -useZakimTopics option.
  This also causes commands for Zakim (‘next agendum’, ‘q+’, ‘zakim,
  list participants’, etc.) and Zakim's answers to be treated as
  normal text for the minutes, rather than skipped.

  <!--
  <dt id="inputFormat">-inputFormat NameOfFormat

  <dd>
  <p>Force input to be treated as NameOfFormat, which must be one of
  the formats listed in <a href="#input_formats" >Input Formats</a>.
  This option is not normally needed, as the input format will
  normally be guessed.
  -->
  </dl>

  <h3 id="options_output_format">Output Format Options</h3>

  <p>These options control the output format.</p>

  <dl>
   <dt>-scribeOnly <dd>Only include what the scribe wrote. Discard any
   statements made on IRC.

   <dt id=final>-final <dt>-nodraft <dd>By default, scribe.perl
    includes a ‘- DRAFT -’ header in the formatted output, to remind
    you that the generated minutes still need manual editing.
    <code>-final</code> (or <code>-nodraft</code>) omits the "- DRAFT
    -" header.

   <dt>-nofinal <dt>-draft <dd>[DEFAULT] Include a ‘- DRAFT -’ header.

   <dt>-embedDiagnostics <dd>Embed scribe.perl's
    diagnostic output into the generated minutes. This is most useful
    when scribe.perl is run as part of an automated process that
    otherwise would not display the diagnostic output to the user.

   <dt>-noEmbedDiagnostics <dd>[DEFAULT] Write diagnostic output to
    the console (stderr).

   <dt id=keeplines>-keeplines / -nokeepLines <dd><p>In the formatted
     minutes, continuation lines are, by default, shown on a line of
     their own, starting with ‘…’. (The HTML output contains a
     &lt;br&gt; to force a new line to start.). E.g., input such as

    <pre>&lt;pdh&gt; Camille: This works fine.
&lt;pdh&gt; ... I tested it.
&lt;pdh&gt; ... See the report.</pre>

    <p>Will produce output similar to this:

    <blockquote>
     <p><strong>Camille:</strong> This works fine.<br>
      … I tested it.<br>
      … See the report.
    </blockquote>

    <p>With <code>-nokeepLines</code>, the lines are instead shown as
     a single paragraph, without any ‘…’:

    <blockquote>
     <p><strong>Camille:</strong> This works fine. I tested it. See
      the report.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Default is <code>-keeplines</code>.

   <dt id=emphasis>-emphasis <dd><p>Cause scribe.perl to interpret
    ‘ASCII highlighting’, arrows, smileys and mathematical formulas.

    <p>ASCII highlighting gives underlined, italic, bold and monospaced text:
    <table>
     <thead>
      <tr><th>Input <th>Output
     <tbody>
      <tr><td><code>_underlined_</code> <td><u>underlined</u>
      <tr><td><code>/italic/</code> <td><i>italic</i>
      <tr><td><code>*bold*</code> <td><b>bold</b>
      <tr><td><code>`monospace`</code> <td><code>monospace</code>
    </table>

    <p>Highlighted phrases must be
    surrounded by spaces to be recognized or be at the edge of the
    line. They may be nested: <code> this is */bold italics/*.</code>

    <p>The option also causes the replacement of ASCII arrows
     and ASCII smileys:

    <table>
     <thead>
      <tr><th>Input <th>Output
     <tbody>
      <tr><td><code>&lt;-</code> <td>←
      <tr><td><code>&lt;--</code> <td>⟵
      <tr><td><code>&lt;=</code> <td>⇐
      <tr><td><code>&lt;==</code> <td>⟸
      <tr><td><code>==&gt;</code> <td>⟹
      <tr><td><code>=&gt;</code> <td>⇒

      <tr><td><code>,-)</code> <td>😜&#xFE0E;

    </table>

    <p>Mathematical formulas use L<sup style="margin-left:

    <p>Math requires an external program called ‘latexmlmath’ (part of
     a suite of programs called ‘latexml’). If you run scribe.perl and
     do not have ‘latexmlmath’, the formulas will remain in

   <dt id=urldisplay>-urlDisplay break <dd>[DEFAULT] Scribe.perl will
    ensure that
    long URLs can be broken at the end of a line, even in browsers
    that normally do not break URLs. This is done by inserting
    HTML's &lt;wbr&gt; tags after most slashes (/).

   <dt>-urlDisplay shorten <dd>Long URLs are shortened by displaying
    just the first and the last few characters, like this:
    ‘http:…c.html’.

   <dt>-urlDisplay full <dd>Long URLs are displayed as they are.

   <dt id=collapseLimit>-collapseLimit <var>N</var> <dd>If there are
    more participants or more regrets than <var>N</var>, the list of
    participants or regrets is collapsed (with HTML's &lt;details&gt;
    element). The reader needs to click on it to see the whole
    list. The default is 30.

   <dt id=githubissues>-nogithubIssues <dd>Do not make links out of
    text that looks like (GitHub) issues.

   <dt id=ghurlbot>-noghurlbot <dd>Omit messages from
    <a href="https://w3c.github.io/GHURLBot/manual.html"
    >gb (a.k.a. ghurlbot)</a>. Messages <em>to</em> gb are still
    interpreted, but gb's responses, such as summaries of issues
    and actions, are removed.
  </dl>

  <h3 id="options_template">Template Options</h3>

  <p>Scribe.perl can generate HTML with a couple of different styles:

  <dl>
   <dt>-member <dd>Use the style sheet for member-only minutes, rather
    than the style sheet for public minutes.

   <dt>-team <dd>Use the style sheet for team-only minutes, rather
    than the style sheet for public minutes.

   <dt id=fancy>-fancy <dd> Omit the W3C logo from the output and use
    a style sheet that makes the output look very different.

   <dt id=oldStyle>-oldStyle <dd>Use the 2004 style sheets for public
    minutes. Or, if combined with <code>-team</code> or
    <code>-member</code>, use the 2004 style for team, resp. member
    minutes.

   <dt id=style>-style <var>URL</var> <dd>Use the given style sheet. The usual
    member, team or public styles become alternative styles instead.

   <dt id=logo>-logo <var>markup</var> <dd>Replace the link to W3C and
    the W3C logo by the given markup. I.e., the usual <code>&lt;a
    href="https://www.w3.org/">&lt;img
    src="https://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_home\" alt=W3C border=0
    height=48 width=72>&lt;/a></code> is replaced by
    <var>markup</var>. To suppress the logo, use <code>-nologo</code>
    (or <code>-logo=""</code>).

   <dt id=mathjax>-mathjax <var>URL</var> <dd>Use the given URL to
    load the MathJax script from, instead of the default. MathJax is a
    script that improves the rendering of mathematical formulas. This
    option only has effect in combination with <code>-emphasis</code>
    and then only if there is any math in the minutes.

   <dt id=islide>-islide <var>URL</var> <dd>Use the given URL to load
    the i-slide script from, instead of the
    default. (See <a href="#slides">'Embedding slides’</a>.)
  </dl>

  <h3 id="options_scribe_identification">Scribe Identification Options</h3>

  <dl>
   <!--
   <dt>-scribe Name <dd>Specify the name of the scribe, as it should
    appear in the generated minutes. If Name appears in the input as
    an IRC nickname, it will also be taken as the scribe's nickname,
    as if specified by the -scribeNick option (below). This option may
    be used multiple times to indicate multiple scribes.</dd>
   -->

   <dt id=scribenick-option>-scribeNick <var>nickName</var>
    <dd>Indicate the IRC nickname of the scribe, which is used to
    figure out which lines were written by the scribe. This scribenick
    will be used for the first lines of the log, until the first
    ‘scribenick’ command in the log itself. (If this option is not
    given, scribe.perl assumes that that first <code>scribe</code> or
    <code>scribenick</code> command also applies to the lines before
    that command.)
  </dl>

  <p>Underscores (‘_’) at the end of scribe nicks are ignored, because
   many IRC clients add them automatically, often after a network
   error when the original nickname still lingers on the server.

  <p>However, occasionally ‘foo’ and ‘foo_’ may actually be different
   people. So it is advisable to change your nickname back to one
   without an underscore.

  <h3 id="options_misc">Miscellaneous Options</h3>

  <dl>
   <dt>-minutes http://example.org/2005/03/01-baking-club-minutes
   <dd>Specify the URL where you will eventually publish the generated
   minutes. This URL is not actually used anywhere except that
   scribe.perl looks at it to guess the meeting date if it isn't given
   explicitly. In particular, scribe.perl checks if the URL happens to
   contain a pattern of the form yyyy/mm/dd.

   <dt>-help <dd>Show a brief summary of command line options.

   <dt>-version <dd>Show the version numbers of scribe.perl and of
   perl itself.
  </dl>

  <h2 id="one_time_commands">Commands</h2>

  <p>Commands are interspersed with other minuted text in your IRC
   log, except that each command must be on a line by itself. Commands
   may be issued by anyone, not only the scribe. Syntax is shown below
   by example, with italicized portions variable.

  <h3 id="correcting_mistakes">Editing Commands</h3>

  <p>These editing commands are usually the easiest way to correct
   simple mistakes or add clarifications. (Of course, they don't take
   effect until you run scribe.perl on your IRC log.)

<pre class="command">s/old/new/
s/old/new
s|old|new|
s|old|new</pre>

  <p>Replace the most recent occurrence of old with new. Old is a
   literal string, not a regular expression. These commands are
   processed in order, first to last. (I.e., each command works on the
   text that results after the previous command.)

  <p><var>new</var> may contain slashes and vertical bars. E.g., this works:
   <code>s/@@/http://example.org/path/</code>. But note that the last
   slash is taken as part of the command, not of the new string. To
   include a final slash, double it
   (<code>s/@@/http://example.org/path//</code>) or use the alternative
   syntax: <code>s|@@|http://example.org/path/</code>.

  <p><var>old</var> cannot be empty, but <var>new</var> can
   be. E.g.: <code>s/some//</code>.

  <p>Unlike in Perl, backslashes are not special. E.g.,
   <code>s/and\/or/but</code> will try to replace ‘and\’ by ‘or/but’

  <p>Successful substitutions are removed from the minutes.
   Unsuccessful ones are left in the minutes, so they can be manually
   edited.

  <pre class="command">s/old/new/g
s|old|new|g</pre>

  <p>Replace globally from this point backward.

  <pre class="command">s/old/new/G
s|old|new|G</pre>

  <p>Replace globally, both forward and backward.

<pre class="command">i/locationString/lineToInsert
i/locationString/lineToInsert/
i|locationString|lineToInsert
i|locationString|lineToInsert|
</pre>

  <p>Insert lineToInsert before the line containing locationString,
   which is a literal string, not a regular expression. This is most
   helpful if you forgot to insert a ‘Topic: ’ command.

  <p>For example, the following use of the i// command:

  <pre class="command">&lt;Arthur&gt; Finished with issue LC71; on to LC82.
&lt;Arthur&gt; Frank: This is about syntax
&lt;Arthur&gt; ... Do we care about syntax?
&lt;dbooth&gt; i/Frank: This is about/Topic: Issue LC82</pre>

  <p>is converted to:

<pre class="command">&lt;Arthur&gt; Finished with issue LC71; on to LC82.
&lt;inserted&gt; Topic: Issue LC82
&lt;Arthur&gt; Frank: This is about syntax
&lt;Arthur&gt; ... Do we care about syntax?</pre>

  <h3 id="commands_general">General Commands</h3>

  <p>The following commands may be written with any mix of uppercase
   and lowercase letters: ‘Meeting’, ‘MEETING’ and ‘mEeTiNg’ are all
   the same thing.

  <pre class="command">Meeting: Baking Club</pre>

  <p>Use "Baking Club" as the title of the meeting minutes. If used
   multiple times, only the last one has effect.

  <pre class="command">Chair: Jonathan</pre>

  <p>Jonathan was the meeting chair. If used multiple times, only the
   last one has effect.

  <pre class="command">chair: Jonathan, Louis
Chair+ Mia
chair+ Zoe, Pete, Annabel</pre>

  <p>If there are multiple chairs, you can separate their names with
   commas, or use the ‘chair+’ command. The combined result of the
   three lines above is that the meeting minutes will show that there
   were <em>six</em> chairs.

  <pre class="command">chair- Louis, Pete</pre>

  <p>If you made a mistake, you can remove individual names from the
   list of chairs.

  <pre class="command">chair+
chair-</pre>

  <p>And if you use ‘chair+’ or ‘chair-’ without any names, it means
   that you add, respectively remove, your own nickname from the list
   of chairs.

  <pre class="command" id="scribe">Scribe: MaryScr
ScribeNick: MaryScr</pre>

  <p>Tells scribe.perl that the IRC name of the scribe is MaryScr. If
   somebody else takes over as scribe, just give the command again,
   with the nick name of the new scribe.

  <p>‘Scribenick’ is an alternative spelling. Whenever you use
   ‘scribe’, you can also use ‘scribenick’.

  <pre class="command" id="real-name">Scribe: jon2 = John Smith
Scribe: jon2 / John Smith</pre>

  <p>You can add the scribe's real name, separated from the IRC name
   with a slash or an equals sign. This changes how the scribe will be
   called in the summary at the top of the minutes. Useful if the IRC
   name is cryptic.

  <pre class="command" id="multiple">Scribe: Adam, Teo, Ana
Scribe:+ Adam/Adamsky, Teo, Ana=Jo-Ana</pre>

  <p>Multiple scribes can be active at the same time. Separate their
   names with commas. Of course, you can also add their real name
   after the nick name.

  <pre class="command">Scribe+ jon2
Scribe+: jon2
Scribe+ jon2/John Smith
Scribe+ jon2, adam=Adamsky</pre>

  <p>Use ‘scribe+’ (with or without a ‘:’) if one or more scribes
   start taking minutes in addition to, rather than replacing, the
   previous scribes.

  <pre class="command">Scribe- adam
Scribe- adam,teo</pre>

  <p>Indicates when some scribes stop taking minutes.

  <pre class="command">Scribe+
Scribe-</pre>

  <p>If there are no names after the ‘+’ or ‘-’, it means the person
   typing the command is adding or removing <em>himself</em> from the
   current list of scribes.

  <p>A scribe can, e.g., temporarily stop taking minutes
   (<code>scribe-</code>) and resume later (<code>scribe+</code>).

  <pre class="command" id="noscribe">Scribe: *</pre>

  <p>A ‘*’ as the scribenick means there is no designated
   scribe, but everybody is taking notes together. This is useful,
   e.g., when IRC is used for taking notes in a face-to-face meeting,
   when IRC isn't needed as a second conversation channel. (But people
   can still start their lines with their own nick, <code>&lt;nick&gt;
   ...</code>, <a href="#scribeirc">see above,</a> to make remarks
   outside the minutes.)

  <p>People cannot remove themselves from the scribe list with
   <code>scribe-</code> after this command.

  <pre class="command">Agenda: http://www.example.com/agenda.html</pre>

  <p>Specify the agenda URL (optional). If used multiple times, only
   the last one has effect.

  <p>Hint: If the agenda has been posted to the W3C Group Calendar or
    to a W3C mailing
    list, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/AgendaBot/manual.html"
    >AgendaBot</a> may be able to find the URL for you.

  <pre class="command" id=present>Present: Jonathan, Mary, Barbara, Steve</pre>

  <p>Indicate who was present.

  <pre class="command">Regrets: Nathan, Emma</pre>

  <p>Indicate who sent regrets (optional).

  <pre class="command">&lt;frank> present+: Janine, Brian
&lt;frank> present- Nathan
&lt;frank> regrets+ Marja, Leonard
&lt;frank> Present+</pre>

  <p>Add or remove names from the present/regrets lists. The colon is
   optional after + or -. With no names, it adds or removes the
   speaker himself, i.e., the last line adds "frank".

  <pre class="command">Date: 05 Dec 2002</pre>

  <p>Specify the meeting date. Not usually needed, because the default
   is guessed from the log URL reported by RRSAgent.

  <pre class="command">ACTION: Frank, Mary and Kate to propose solution for issue 42
action Ann: publish report 17
Action Fred to do something</pre>

  <p>Three ways to give an action item: ‘action:’, ‘action name:’ and
   ‘action name to’. (Other bots, may require that
   only one of these syntaxes is used.)

  <pre class="command">RESOLUTION: Issue 42 closed as duplicate of issue 21
Resolved: next-object does not wrap</pre>

  <p>Indicate a decision that the group has made. Both keywords may be
   used interchangeably.

  <pre id="topic" class="command">topic: Food and drink
subtopic: Morning coffee</pre>

  <p>The first starts a new section with the heading ‘Food and
   drink’. The second starts a subsection with the heading ‘Morning
   coffee’. (See also <a href="#dashTopics" >-dashtopics</a>
   and <a href="useZakimTopics" >-useZakimTopics</a> for alternative
   syntaxes.)

  <!--
  <pre class="command">Log: http://www.w3.org/2002/11/07-ws-arch-irc</pre>

  <p>Explicitly indicate the IRC log location. Not usually needed,
   because the script normally infers it from statements like:</p>

  <pre class="command">&lt;dbooth&gt; rrsagent, where am i?
&lt;RRSAgent&gt; See http://www.w3.org/2002/11/07-ws-arch-irc#T13-59-36</pre>
  -->

  <pre class="command" id="command_scribeoptions">ScribeOptions: -dashTopics -embedDiagnostics</pre>

  <p>Specify options inline, as if they had been written on the
  command line like:

  <code>perl scribe.perl -dashTopics -embedDiagnostics</code>. Can be
  used multiple times and the options are added to previous ones.

  <pre class="command">NamedAnchorHere: foo</pre>

  <p>Cause a named anchor ‘foo’ to be generated at this point in the
  minutes. Leading and trailing spaces are ignored and other spaces
  are converted to underlines (‘_’). The name can be almost anything, except
  ‘xNN’, where N is a digit, because those are reserved for
  scribe.perl's internal use.
  A few other words (toc, meeting, attendees, links,
  resolutionsummary, and actionsummary) are also forbidden, because
  scribe.perl uses them itself.

  <pre class="command">Next meeting: http:///example.org/20180214/mins
Previous meeting: http://example.org/20180228/mins</pre>

  <p>You can add a link to the previous and next meeting at the top of
   the minutes.

  <h3 id="escaped">Escapes</h3>

  <p>If you <em>don't</em> want a line to be interpreted by
  scribe.perl, start it with a backslash. E.g.:

  <pre class="command">&lt;gigi&gt; here are some words:
&lt;gigi&gt; \Subject: a noun
&lt;gigi&gt; \Topic: same as Subject
&lt;gigi&gt; \Ben: a name
&lt;gigi&gt; \Action: a noun</pre>

  <p>Even if gigi is the scribe, the above will not be taken as lines
  spoken by ‘Ben’ or by ‘Subject’ and will not create a new topic or a
  new action. A few more examples:

  <pre class="command">&lt;jany&gt; \s/week/month/
&lt;jany&gt; \scribe+
&lt;jany&gt; \present + Jan</pre>

  <p>Such an initial backslash is omitted from the minutes. If you
  happen to have a line that <em>should</em> start with a backslash,
  double it:

  <pre class="command">&lt;jany&gt; Here are some escapes used in C:
&lt;jany&gt; \\n = newline
&lt;jany&gt; \\t = tab</pre>

  <p>Backslashes elswhere than at the start are not special. E.g., you
  could write the above like this:

  <pre class="command">&lt;jany&gt; Here are some escapes used in C:
&lt;jany&gt; * \n = newline
&lt;jany&gt; * \t = tab</pre>

  <h3 id="verbatim">Verbatim or pasted text</h3>

  <p>To include several lines of verbatim text, e.g., to copy-paste
  program code into the minutes, start with three single backquotes
  (<code>```</code>) or two square brackets (<code>[[</code>) on a
  line by themselves, paste the text and end with a line containing
  another three backquotes, resp. two square brackets
  (<code>]]</code>).

  <p>No commands are recognized inside verbatim text: ‘action:’ does
  not create an action, ‘present+’ does not record a participant. etc.
  Here are two examples:

  <pre class="command">&lt;dbooth&gt; ```
&lt;dbooth&gt; function factorial(n) {
&lt;dbooth&gt;   if (n == 1) return 1
&lt;dbooth&gt;   else return n * factorial(n - 1)
&lt;dbooth&gt; }
&lt;dbooth&gt; ```
&lt;momo&gt; [[
&lt;momo&gt; January    45
&lt;momo&gt; February  250
&lt;momo&gt; March       2
&lt;momo&gt; ]]</pre>

  <p>Everybody can use verbatim text, but the effect is slightly
  different for scribes and for other participants. If the scribe
  enters verbatim text and other text interrupts the verbatim text,
  that other text is moved, to keep the scribe's text together. E.g.,

  <pre class="command">&lt;scribe&gt; [[
&lt;scribe&gt; sub add($$) {
&lt;scribe&gt;    my ($a, $b) = @_;
&lt;cecilia&gt; Me too!
&lt;scribe&gt;    return $a + $b;
&lt;scribe&gt; }
&lt;scribe&gt; ]]</pre>

  <p>will yield:
  <blockquote>
<pre>sub add($$) {
   my ($a, $b) = @_;
   return $a + $b;
}</pre>
&lt;cecilia&gt; Me too!
  </blockquote>

  <p>(The verbatim text feature was suggested by David Booth.)

  <h2 id="links">Embedding links</h2>

  <p>Scribe.perl automatically recognizes most URLs
  (<code>http://…</code>, <code>mailto:…</code>, etc.) and turns them
  into links. See the command line option <a
  href="#urldisplay"><code>-urlDisplay</code></a> for different ways
  to format URLs.

  <p id="ralph-link">You can provide anchor text for a link with
  <code>-&gt;</code>. This <code>-&gt;</code> must either come before
  the URL and the anchor text or in between. (The idea to use
  <code>-&gt;</code> is due to Ralph Swick.) More precisely, you can
  use any of the following:

  <p>A <strong>Ralph link</strong> has <code>-&gt;</code> followed by
  a URL followed by anchor text, like this:

<pre class=command>
&lt;dbooth&gt; See -&gt; https://www.example.org/ns/w2 wall 2
&lt;dbooth&gt; And -&gt; https://www.example.org/ns/w2 "wall 2", too.
&lt;dbooth&gt; -&gt; https://www.example.org/ns/w2 'wall 2' also.
</pre>

  <p>If the anchor text is quoted (as in the second and third lines
  above), scribe.perl uses only the quoted text as anchor, otherwise
  it takes all the text until the end of the line. Thus, all three
  lines contain the link <a href="https://www.example.org/ns/w2">wall
  2</a>.

  <p id="xueyuan-link">A <strong>Xueyuan link</strong> has
  the <code>-&gt;</code> between the anchor text and the URL:

<pre class=command>
&lt;dbooth&gt; wall 2 -&gt; https://www.example.org/ns/w2
</pre>

  <p>The anchor text is all the text leading up to the
  <code>-&gt;</code>. You should not put quotes around it, unless you
  actually want quotes in the anchor text.

  <p>The anchor text and URL can also swap places. This is known as an
  <strong>inverted Xueyuan link:</strong>

<pre class=command>
&lt;dbooth&gt; See https://www.example.org/ns/w2 -&gt; wall 2
&lt;dbooth&gt; And https://www.example.org/ns/w2 -&gt; "wall 2", too.
&lt;dbooth&gt; https://www.example.org/ns/w2 -&gt; 'wall 2' also.
</pre>

  <p>In this case, like with the Ralph links, you can use quotes to
  limit what goes into the anchor text.

  <p id="ivan-link">An <strong>Ivan link</strong> is like
  a Ralph link, but with the anchor text and the URL swapped:

<pre class=command>
&lt;dbooth&gt; -&gt; wall 2 https://www.example.org/ns/w2
&lt;dbooth&gt; And -&gt; wall 2 https://www.example.org/ns/w2 too.
</pre>

  <p>Like Xueyuan links, Ivan links should not have quotes around the
  text (unless you actually want the anchor text to contain quotes).

  <p id="md-link">And finally, a <strong>Markdown link</strong> uses
  the popular markdown syntax to create links:

<pre class=command>
&lt;dbooth&gt; Some text with [an embedded link](https://www.example.org/ns/w2) and more text
</pre>


  <h2 id="images">Embedding images</h2>

  <p>You can also embed images in the minutes by means of Ralph,
  (inverted) Xueyuan or Ivan links. The only difference is that
  the <code>-&gt;</code> must be replaced by <code>--&gt;</code>. Some
  examples:

<pre class=command>
&lt;dbooth&gt; See --&gt; https://www.example.org/ns/w2.jpg wall 2
&lt;dbooth&gt; And --&gt; https://www.example.org/ns/w2.jpg "wall 2", too.
&lt;dbooth&gt; --&gt; https://www.example.org/ns/w2,jpg 'wall 2' also.
&lt;dbooth&gt; wall 2 --&gt; https://www.example.org/ns/w2.jpg
&lt;dbooth&gt; See https://www.example.org/ns/w2.jpg --&gt; wall 2
&lt;dbooth&gt; And https://www.example.org/ns/w2.jpg --&gt; "wall 2", too.
&lt;dbooth&gt; https://www.example.org/ns/w2.jpg --&gt; 'wall 2' also.
&lt;dbooth&gt; --&gt; wall 2 https://www.example.org/ns/w2.jpg
&lt;dbooth&gt; And --&gt; wall 2 https://www.example.org/ns/w2.jpg too.
</pre>

  <p>The anchor text becomes the image's text alternative (‘alt
  text’). There is no way to specify a caption.</p>

  <p>Markdown-style image links also work. They are like markdown
  links, but prefixed with a ‘!':

<pre class=command>
&lt;dbooth&gt; Here it as an image: ![a tree](https://example.org/tree.jpg)
</pre>

  <h2 id="issue-links">Links to (GitHub) issues and pull requests</h2>

  <p>Unless disabled (see <a href="#githubissues">-nogithubIssues</a>),
  text that looks like a reference to a GitHub issue is replaced by a
  link to that issue:

  <pre class=command>
&lt;dbooth&gt; Let's talk about w3c/scribe#3
&lt;dbooth&gt; And transitions#5
</pre>

  <p>If the owner part is omitted, ‘w3c’ is assumed (thus,
  ‘transitions#5’ is the same as ‘w3c/transitions#5’). But you can
  change that by explicitly listing the repositories to use, by means
  of one or more <code>repo:</code>
  (or <code>repos</code>, <code>repository</code>
  or <code>repositories</code>) commands:

  <pre class=command>
&lt;dbooth&gt; Repo: w3c/scribe, transitions, webn/drafts
&lt;dbooth&gt; Repo: docs, w3c/scribe2
...
&lt;dbooth&gt; Let talk about #3, drafts#7 and tests#1
</pre>

  <p>(A <code>+</code> instead of a <code>:</code> also works.) The
  first line defines three repositories:
  https://github.com/w3c/scribe (if no other web site is given,
  github.com is assumed), https://github.com/w3c/transitions (the URL
  and owner are copied from the preceding repository) and
  https://github.com/webn/drafts (the URL is copied from the preceding
  repo). The second line defines two additional repositories:
  https://github.com/webn/docs (again, the initial part is copied from
  the preceding repository) and https://github.com/w3c/scribe2.

  <p>The ‘#3’ is now a valid issue as well and refers to issue 3 in
  the last defined repository, which is
  https://github.com/w3c/scribe2; the ‘drafts#7’ refers to the most
  recently defined repository called ‘drafts’, i.e.,
  https://github.com/webn/webn/drafts’; and the ‘test#1’, which does
  not match any defined repository, is assumed to have the same owner
  as the last repository, i.e., https://github.com/w3c/tests.

  <p>You can also give full URLs (which is necessary to refer to
  repositories that are not on GitHub):

  <pre class=command>
&lt;dbooth&gt; Repo: https://gitlab.example.com/foo/bar, baz
</pre>

  <p>This defines the repositories https://gitlab.example.com/foo/bar
  and https://gitlab.example.com/foo/baz.

  <p>Repositories that are mentioned in topic lines are also added to
  the defined repositories. This only works for repositories on
  github.com:

  <pre class=command>topic: Discuss https://github.com/w3c/scribe2</pre>

  <p>Remove repositories from the list with <code>repo-</code>
  (or <code>repos-</code>, <code>repository-</code>
  or <code>repositories-</code>):

  <pre class=command>Repo- w3c/scribe2</pre>

  <p>To remove all repositories, give an empty list:

  <pre class=command>&lt;dbooth&gt; Repo:</pre>

  <p>Scribe.perl also interprets the commands for ghurlbot
  that <a href="https://w3c.github.io/GHURLBot/manual.html#repo"
  >add</a>
  or <a href="https://w3c.github.io/GHURLBot/manual.html#remove"
  >remove</a> repositories, e.g:

  <pre class=command>
&lt;dbooth&gt; ghurlbot, this is https://gitlab.example.com/foo/bar
&lt;dbooth&gt; ghurlbot, drop baz
</pre>

  <h2 id="slides">Embedding slides</h2>

  <p>You can embed slides in the minutes if they are in a supported format.
  The list of supported formats depends on the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i-slide#supported-slide-formats">i-slide library</a>, and includes PDF, and the HTML-based <a href="https://shwr.me/">Shower</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/b6plus/">b6+</a>.
  Google Slides are also supported.</p>
  <p>To use this, the slideset from which the slides will be embedded
  needs to be set with a <code>slideset</code> command and a URL,
  e.g.:</p>

  <pre class=command>
&lt;dbooth&gt; Slideset: https://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/b6plus/
&lt;dbooth&gt; Slideset: -> my slides https://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/b6plus/
</pre>

  <p>Then an individual slide can be embedded using the convention <code>[Slide <var>n</var>]</code> where <var>n</var> is the slide number in the slideset.</p>
<pre class=command>
&lt;dbooth&gt; [Slide 2]
&lt;dbooth&gt; Dom: as this slide illustrates, scribing is awesome
</pre>

  <p id="google-slides">Note: In the case of Google Slides,
  scribe.perl makes a snapshot in PDF. It is that snapshot that is
  shown in the minutes. For other slides, the minutes display the live
  version. Security rules (‘CORS’) may restrict the display of slides
  that reside on remote servers.</p>

  <h2 id="recording">Embedding Video Recording</h2>

  <p>You can link to the video record of a meeting in the minutes. The
  video will be embedded at the top of the minutes and each topic and
  subtopic of the meeting will link to the approximate time in the
  video. (This only works for IRC logs that include time stamps, such
  as RRSAgent's.)</p>

  <p>With JavaScript enabled, each topic and subtopic will also offer
  a play button to launch the embedded video at the appropriate
  offset. The video will float at the bottom of the page, if it is not
  visible at the current scroll level. (Launching the video works for
  video streaming services that use a
  recognized <code>postMessage</code> API. This includes YouTube,
  CloudFlare Stream and StreamFizz).</p>

  <p>To use this, the link to the recording needs to be set
  with <code>recording</code> and a URL, e.g.:</p>

  <pre class=command>
&lt;dbooth&gt; Recording: https://youtu.be/PjpACM_6IgM
&lt;dbooth&gt; Recording: -> https://youtu.be/PjpACM_6IgM April meeting video
</pre>

  <p>The point at which the recording starts also needs to be
  explicitly set. This can be done live, at the moment when recording
  is started with:</p>

  <pre class=command>
&lt;dbooth&gt; Recording is starting
  </pre>

  <p>It can also be documented after the fact, with:</p>

  <pre class=command>
&lt;dbooth&gt; Recording started at :05
  </pre>

  <p>where <code>:05</code> means at 5 minutes from the top of the
  hour.</p>

  <p>If the recording ends before the end of the meeting, the end of
  that recording can be documented similarly with:</p>

  <pre class=command>
&lt;dbooth&gt; Recording ends
&lt;dbooth&gt; Recording ended at :55
  </pre>

  <p>There can be only one recording. If the above commands are used
  multiple times, the last one wins.</p>

  <h2 id="editing_the_log">Manually Editing the Log</h2>

  <p>In addition to the ‘realtime’ <a href="#correcting_mistakes"
  >editing commands</a> above, you may manually edit your IRC log with
  a text editor (by mimicking the log format) before running
  scribe.perl. This is most useful for commands that have a broad
  effect on the generated HTML. Scribe.perl also recognizes RRSAgent's
  log format <em>without</em> time stamps, so you can leave those off,
  rather than invent fake ones.

  <p>Here is an example snippet of an IRC log in which the commands
   ‘ScribeNick: tw’ and ‘Topic: Fire Alarms’ have been inserted using
   a text editor.</p>

<pre class="command">20:11:21 &lt;tw&gt; Scribe: TedWilliams
&lt;tw&gt; ScribeNick: tw
20:11:34 &lt;tw&gt; Topic: Printers
20:11:49 &lt;tw&gt; alan: Printers are working now
&lt;tw&gt; Topic: Fire Alarms
20:12:27 &lt;tw&gt; ralph: Fire marshall assured us that the system is working.
</pre>

  <p>Note that the IRC name &lt;tw&gt; <i>is</i> required, though for
   most commands it does not matter what IRC name is specified.</p>


  <h2 id="input_formats">Input Formats</h2>

  <p>Several log formats are recognized, and are described below:

  <ul>
   <li><a href="#RRSAgent_Text_Format" >RRSAgent text format</a>
    (RECOMMENDED)

   <li><a href="scribedoc.htm#Mirc_Timestamped_Log_Format"
     >Mirc_Timestamped_Log_Format</a>

   <li><a href="#Mirc_Text_Format" >Mirc text format</a>

   <!--<li><a href="#XChat_Timestamped_Log_Format"
     >XChat_Timestamped_Log_Format</a>-->

   <li><a href="#Irssi_Format" >Irssi format</a>

   <li><a href="#Bip_Format" >Bip format</a>

   <li><a href="#Yahoo_IM_Format" >Yahoo IM format</a>

   <li><a href="#Plain_Text_Format" >Plain-text format</a>

   <li><a href="#Qwebirc_Paste_Format" >Qwebirc paste format</a>

   <li><a href="#Quassel_Paste_Format" >Quassel paste format</a>

   <li><a href="#Bert_IRSSI_Format" >Bert IRSSI format</a>

   <li><a href="#IRCCloud_format" >IRCCloud format</a>
  </ul>

  <p>Scribe.perl guesses which format you have used by trying each in
   turn until it finds one one that matches.

  <p>If you have a log format that is not recognized:

  <ol>
   <li>Try doing global search/replace in a text editor, to convert it
    into a recognized format, such as <a
    href="#Mirc_Text_Format" >Mirc_Text_Format</a>; or

   <li>Write a parser for it and add it to scribe.perl.
  </ol>

  <h3 id="RRSAgent_Text_Format">RRSAgent text format (recommended)</h3>

  <p>The plain text format (*.txt) produced by RRSAgent.  Hint: add
   ".txt" to the RRSAgent log URL to get the text version, such as:
   http://www.w3.org/2002/11/07-ws-arch-irc.txt .  The timestamps are
   ignored, so you can safely edit the log and add lines without
   having to fake
   timestamps. <a href="https://www.w3.org/2003/03/03-ws-desc-irc.txt"
   >Example:</a></p>

<pre class="command">20:41:27 &lt;dbooth&gt; Mike: Feature X would benefit users.
20:41:37 &lt;dbooth&gt; ... and implementation would be easy.
20:41:47 &lt;ericn&gt; I agree.
</pre>

  <h3 id="Mirc_Timestamped_Log_Format">Mirc timestamped log format</h3>

	<p>Timestamped log format produced by mIRC.  Example:
	</p>
<pre class="command">
[19:35] &lt;Zakim&gt; Steven should now be muted
[19:36] &lt;ph&gt; http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-html-cg/2004JanMar/0038.html
[19:36] * Zakim hears Steven's hand up
[19:36] * Zakim sees Steven on the speaker queue
</pre>

  <h3 id="Mirc_Text_Format">Mirc text format</h3>

<p>	The format produced by mIRC when you do Buffer&rarr;Save As.  Example:
</p>
<pre class="command">
&lt;dbooth&gt; Mike: Feature X would benefit users.
&lt;dbooth&gt; ... and implementation would be easy.
&lt;dbooth&gt; This is pretending to be a long
 line that mIRC breaks in order to display,
 but scribe.perl will re-join into a single line.
&lt;ericn&gt; I agree.
</pre>

<!--
	<h3 id="XChat_Timestamped_Log_Format">XChat_Timestamped_Log_Format</h3>
	<p>Timestamped log format produced by X-Chat.  <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2005Feb/0026.html">Example</a>:</p>
<pre class="command" id="body">

  <h3 id="Irssi_Format">Irssi format</h3>

	<p>The format produced by Irssi logging with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime">ISO8601 timestamp</a> prefixes.  Example:</p>

<pre class="command">2003-12-18T15:27:21-0500Z &lt;dbooth&gt; Mike: Feature X would benefit users.
2003-12-18T15:27:36-0500Z &lt;dbooth&gt; ... and implementation would be easy.
2003-12-18T15:27:36-0500Z &lt;ericn&gt; I agree.

2003-12-18T16:38:58Z  * koalie hears Steve
</pre>

<p>The date, seconds and timezone are optional, so the following is also recognized:
</p>
<pre class="command">15:27 &lt;dbooth&gt; Mike: Feature X would benefit users.
15:27 &lt;dbooth&gt; ... and implementation would be easy.
15:27 &lt;ericn&gt; I agree.
</pre>

  <h3 id="Bip_Format">Bip format</h3>

  <p>Bip is an IRC proxy. Its logs look like this:

<pre class="command">
27-02-2020 15:04:33 < addison!~addison@team.cloak: zakim, take up agendum 1
27-02-2020 15:04:33 < Zakim!zakim@team.cloak: agendum 1. "Agenda and Minutes" taken up [from agendabot]

</pre>

  <h3 id="Yahoo_IM_Format">Yahoo IM format</h3>

	<p>The format produced when you save a Yahoo IM session.  Example:</p>
<pre class="command">dbooth: Mike: Feature X would benefit users.
dbooth: ... and implementation would be easy.
ericn: I agree.
</pre>

  <h3 id="Plain_Text_Format">Plain-text format</h3>

	<p>Line-oriented plain text format.  This format is intended for occasions when the scribe doesn't have access to IRC, and simply takes notes in a text editor.  Example:
	</p>
<pre class="command">
	Mike: Feature X would benefit users.... and implementation would be easy.
Eric agrees.
</pre>

  <h3 id="Qwebirc_Paste_Format">Qwebirc paste format</h3>

  <p>Qwebirc is a web-based IRC client.
  Copy-pasting from the browser window gives a log that looks like
  this:

  <pre class="command">

[10:04] &lt;CarlosD> present+
[10:05] &lt;CarlosD> Wilco: provides update on the TF
</pre>

  <h3 id="Quassel_Paste_Format">Quassel paste format</h3>

  <p>The format of text that is copy-pasted from a Quassel chat
  window. The line starts with a date &amp; time in square brackets.

  <p>The format of the date &amp; time can actually be configured by
  the user, but scribe.perl only accepts dates and times that consists
  of <strong>digits, dots, dashes and spaces, optionally with am and
  pm.</strong> Here is an example where the date &amp; time is just
  hours and minutes:

  <pre class="command">
[01:09] &lt;-- borisjohn (borisjohn@899c7108.team.cloak) has quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[08:50] --> raul (raul@899c7108.team.cloak) has joined &amp;fleague

[09:09] &lt;-- borisjohn (borisjohn@899c7108.team.cloak) has quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[10:02] --> borisjohn (borisjohn@899c7108.team.cloak) has joined &amp;fleague
[11:00] -*- kolec still on another call; it may spill a lot

[11:02] &lt;Zakim> RRSAgent, make logs Team
</pre>

  <h3 id="Bert_IRSSI_Format">Bert IRSSI format</h3>

	<p>The style of IRSSI logs as used by Bert Bos, characterized
	by a date &amp; time at the start and a vertical bar
	separating the nick name and the message. This is almost
	identical to the <strong>elho theme</strong> for IRSSI, which
	should work here as well. Here is an example:</p>

	<pre class="command">--- Log opened Thu Mar 19 12:57:23 2015
12:57       «Users» | 23 nicks (0 ops, 0 halfops, 0 voices, 23 normal

13:15             * | Zakim sees no one on the speaker queue
13:15        scribe | Veronica: Please everyone update the FTMS records.</pre>

  <h3 id="IRCCloud_format">IRCCloud format</h3>

  <p>Downloading a log from the IRCCloud server yields a file similar
   to this:

   <pre class="command">#wcag-act

  <h2 id="Environment_Variables">Environment Variables</h2>

  <p>The SCRIBEOPTIONS environment variable holds the default options
   that one wants to use. It is not required. Example for a
   Bourne-style shell:

  <pre>export SCRIBEOPTIONS="-team"</pre>

  <h2 id=changes>Differences from scribe.perl version 1</h2>

  <p>Scribe.perl version 2 accepts most of the same options as
   <a href="https://github.com/w3c/scribe"
   >version 1</a> and recognizes most of the same commands in the input.
   The following are different:

  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>Status codes for actions are not supported. An action preceded
     by a status code, such as ‘<code>[PENDING] ACTION: Joe to write
     text</code>’, is <em>not</em> recognized as an action. It will be
     a simple text. A status cade after the action, such as
     ‘<code>ACTION: Joe to write text [PENDING]</code>’, is simply
     part of the action description.

   <li>
    <p>There is no <code>-template</code> option. Scribe.perl
     version 2 does not accept external HTML templates.

   <li>
    <p>A ‘scribeOptions’ command takes priority over command line
     options, instead of the other way round.

   <li>
    <p>The ‘-inputFormat’ option is not supported. It is not possible
     to override the automatic selection of the input format.

   <li>
    <p>The ‘-tidy’ option is not supported. Scribe.perl version 2
     always generates valid HTML (HTML5, currently).

   <li>
    <p>The ‘-trustRRSAgent’ option is not supported. When RSSAgent is
     dismissed, it summarizes the actions and resolutions it has
     seen, but scribe.perl version 2 does not use them.

   <li>
    <p>The ‘-plain’, ‘-public’ and ‘-mit’ options are not supported.
     Scribe.perl version 2 does not currently have style sheets for
     ‘-plain’ and ‘-mit’. Note that the public style is the default.

   <li>
    <p>The ‘-scribe’ option is not supported.

   <li>
    <p>The ‘-sampleInput’ and ‘-sampleOutput’ options are not
     supported.

   <li>
    <p>The ‘Log:’ command is not supported. It was rarely needed,
     because the URL of the IRC log, if any, can usually be inferred
     from the messages by RRSAgent.

   <li>
    <p>The scribe can make IRC statements as himself by prefixing his
     text with his own nick in angle brackets (see <a
     href="#scribeirc" >example above</a>).

   <li>
    <p>The <code>scribe</code> and <code>scribenick</code> commands no
     longer have different functions. Both of them set the IRC name
     <em>and</em> the real name of the scribes. In order to set a real
     name that is different from the IRC name, use the <a
     href="#real-name">syntax with ‘/’ or ‘=’</a>.

   <li>
    <p>The ScribeNick command accepts <a href="#multiple">multiple
    names</a> (separated by commas), and also accepts <a
    href="#noscribe">‘*’</a>

   <li>
    <p>The '-philippe' and '-plh' options are not supported. Use
    '-dashTopics' instead.

   <li>
    <p>The option <a href="#oldStyle"
    >‘-oldStyle’</a>, <a href="#fancy"
    >‘-fancy’</a>, <a href="#style">‘-style’</a>, <a href="#logo"
    >‘-logo’</a>, <a href="#keeplines"
    >‘-keeplines’/‘-nokeeplines’</a> <a href="#collapseLimit"
    >‘-collapseLimit’</a>, <a href="#emphasis" >‘-emphasis’</a>
    and <a href="#mathjax" >‘-mathjax’</a> are
    new.

   <li>
    <p>Some new text patterns are recognized and marked up with
     special classes: <a href="#ralph-link" >Ralph</a>/<a
     href="#xueyuan-link" >Xueyuan</a>/<a href="#ivan-link" >Ivan
     links</a> (for links with anchor text and images with text
     alternatives), messages
     from <a href="https://www.w3.org/2005/06/tracker/irc"
     >trackbot</a> and the ‘slideset’ and ‘[slide N]’ commands.

   <li>
    <p>The ability to escape a command with a backslash to remove its
    special meaning, and the ability to include verbatim text are new.

   <li>
    <p>The XChat log format is not (yet) supported.

   <li>
    <p>Support for embedded slides and embedded video is new.
  </ul>

  <!--    No addition of [recorded in ....] after an action. -->

    <p>It happens occasionally that you have been happily taking
      minutes in IRC and at the end of the meeting discover (oh
      horror!)  that nobody
      invited <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/03/RRSAgent"
      >RRSAgent</a>! No logs, no minutes… What now?

    <p>RRSAgent does three things: keep a log of what is typed in IRC,
      call a program to turn the log into nice minutes in HTML, and
      upload the minutes. So, without RRSAgent, you will need to do
      those three things yourself. How? It depends on your skills,
      environment and preferences.

    <h2 id=task1>Task 1. Find IRC logs</h2>

    <p>First you need the text that was typed into IRC.

    <p>If you can scroll back up in your IRC window, you may be able
      to find the start of the minutes and <strong>copy-paste</strong>
      all text into an editor window or into the online minutes tool
      (see the next section).

    <p>If you were using an IRC program on your own computer (rather
      than the <a href="http://irc.w3.org/" >web interface</a>), it
      may have kept <strong>logs</strong> in a file, if you previously
      configured it to do so. If you can find that log file, you can
      copy the minutes from there.

    <p>And if that doesn't work, maybe somebody else who was in the
      meeting still has the logs.

    <h2 id=task2>Task 2. Convert the log to minutes in HTML</h2>

    <p>RRSAgent uses a program called scribe.perl to process the text.
      You can process it yourself in one of two ways: using an online
      service or by running scribe.perl locally.

    <p>To use the <strong>online service,</strong> go to the <a
      href="https://www.w3.org/2005/02/minutes">Online Minutes
      Generator</a>. You can copy-paste your text into the text box,
      or, if you have the text in a file, upload the file. The web service will
      try to run scribe.perl to turn the text into minutes in HTML and
      display them. If it succeeds, you can save the page and proceed
      to task 3. Otherwise some editing may help, see <a
      href="#editing">‘editing the log’</a> below.

    <p>To run scribe.perl <strong>locally,</strong> you need
      to <a href="https://w3c.github.io/scribe2/scribe.perl">download
      it</a>. You also need to have Perl installed and you need to
      have access to a command line. Save the text of the minutes into
      a file (e.g., into ‘log.txt’) and type something like:

    <pre class=command>perl scribe.perl log.txt > minutes.html</pre>

    <p>There are
      various <a href="https://w3c.github.io/scribe2/scribedoc.html#options"
      >options you can add</a>, e.g., to select the style or to embed
      scribe.perl's diagnostic messages in the minutes.

    <p>Try to open the result, ‘minutes.html’, in a browser to see if
      the command succeeded. If so, you can proceed to task 3.

    <p id=editing><strong>✏ Editing the log:</strong> If the above didn't produce correct minutes, it may
      be that scribe.perl didn't recognize the format. The section <a
      href="https://w3c.github.io/scribe2/scribedoc.html#input_formats"
      >Input Formats</a> in the manual shows examples of IRC logs that
      scribe.perl knows. Maybe by editing your log in a text editor
      you can make it look sufficiently like one of the recognized
      formats.

    <h2 id=task3>Task 3. Upload the minutes</h2>

    <p>Once you have the minutes, you can send them to a mailing
      list. If the mailing list is archived, that gives them a URL as
      well. But it is also good to have them stored in the usual place
      for minutes under https://www.w3.org/2021/03/ or whatever the
      current year and month is.

    <p>Uploading requires special privileges. Typically, it needs to
      be done by a team member.

    <p>First determine what the URL of the minutes is going to be. The
      conventional URL is of this form:

    <pre class=command>https://www.w3.org/<var>YYYY</var>/<var>MM</var>/<var>DD</var>-<var>xxx</var>-minutes.html</pre>

    <p>Here <var>YYYY</var>, <var>MM</var> and <var>DD</var> represent
      the year, the month and the day of the meeting
      and <var>xxx</var> is the name of the IRC channel on which the
      meeting took place. Some examples:

    <dl>
      <dt>https://www.w3.org/2021/03/02-weum-minutes.html
      <dd>The W3C Europe teleconference of March 2, 2021, on the &amp;weum IRC channel.

      <dt>https://www.w3.org/2020/12/01-events-minutes.html
      <dd>The Event Team meeting of December 1, 2020, on the &amp;events channel.

      <dt>https://www.w3.org/2021/02/02-auto-minutes.html
      <dd>The Automotive WG on February 2, 2021, on the #auto channel.
    </dl>

    <p>Then there are several ways to upload a file.

    <p>A first way is to use <strong>CVS</strong> to upload the minutes.

    <p>Assuming you have already checked out some part of the W3C web
      site somewhere, first make sure you have the
      WWW/<var>YYYY</var>/<var>MM</var> directory checked out, e.g.,
      like this: go to the WWW directory (the root of the checked out
      site) and do this on the command
      line: <code>mkdir <var>YYYY</var>; cvs add <var>YYYY</var>;
      cd <var>YYYY</var>; mkdir <var>MM</var>; cvs add <var>MM</var>;
      cd <var>MM</var></code> (Replace <var>YYYY</var>
      and <var>MM</var> with the year and month, as above.) If one or
      both of the <var>YYYY</var> and <var>MM</var> directories are
      already checked out, this will give some error messages, but in
      any case this puts you in the <var>MM</var> directory. (You can
      of course also use a graphical CVS client.)

    <p>Copy the formatted minutes to this directory and name the file
      <var>DD</var>-<var>xxx</var>-minutes.html. Then check it in with
      <code>cvs commit
      <var>DD</var>-<var>xxx</var>-minutes.html</code> from the
      command line (or the equivalent in your graphical client).

    <p>If you have the <strong>curl</strong> program, a second way is to use it
    from a command line.</p>

    <p>Assuming you put the formatted minutes in minutes.html, the command is:

      <pre class=command>curl --location-trusted -u <var>myusername</var> -T minutes.html https://www.w3.org/<var>YYYY</var>/<var>MM</var>/<var>DD</var>-<var>xxx</var>-minutes.html</pre>

    <p>Where <var>myusername</var> is your username. Curl will prompt
      for your password.

    <p>(The --location-trusted option tells curl to follow
      redirects. In fact, the www.w3.org server doesn't handle the
      upload itself, but redirects to edit.w3.org. That means you
      could also use this shorter command: <code>curl
      -u <var>myusername</var> -T minutes.html
      https://edit.w3.org/<var>YYYY</var>/<var>MM</var>/<var>DD</var>-<var>xxx</var>-minutes.html</code>)


    <p>A third way is to use <strong>WebDav</strong>. If your
      operating system supports the WebDav protocol, or you have a
      WebDav program, you can connect to edit.w3.org and use it almost
      as if it were a directory on your local system. Under Debian and
      similar Linux distributions, you need the davfs package and then
      you can mount the file system (as root) with something like
      <code>mount -t davfs https://edit.w3.org /mnt</code>. After
      that, you can find the contents of edit.w3.org under <code>/mnt</code> and
      you can create the file
      /mnt/<var>YYYY</var>/<var>MM</var>/<var>DD</var>-<var>xxx</var>-minutes.html
      for your minutes. When using KDE, you don't even need to mount
      the file system, just type ‘webdavs://edit.w3.org’ in the
      location bar in Dolphin or Konqueror, navigate to the right
      directory and copy your minutes there. Under MacOS, you can use
      ‘Go’ &rarr; ‘Connect to server’ in the Finder and enter
      ‘https://edit.w3.org’ in the dialog in order to mount
      edit.w3.org as a file system. If you use Emacs, you also don't
      need to mount the file system (assuming the tramp package is
      loaded, which it usually is): You open edit.w3.org as a
      directory by opening ‘/davs:<var>myusername</var>@edit.w3.org:/
      after which you can navigate to the right directory and create
      the minutes file there.

    <p>Note: If WebDav doesn't show you a directory, or the directory
      appears empty, although you know that it isn't, the problem is
      usually that the directory has no access defined. Use
      the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Systems/Acl/UserDoc" >,access
      tool</a> to set the directory to Team-only (or some other
      access, as appropriate).</p>

    <p>If you cannot use any of these ways, please send the minutes
    file to <a href="mailto:sysreq@w3.org">sysreq</a></p>

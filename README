scribe.perl is a program to convert an IRC log with meeting minutes to
HTML.

It is usually invoked on IRC by RRSAgent[1], but can also be run
locally by hand. See scribedoc.html[2] for the IRC conventions it
understands.

This is version 2 of scribe.perl, an improved version of the original
scribe.perl[3,4] by David Booth.

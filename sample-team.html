<h3 id=t02>Canvas 2D Level 1</h3>
<p id=x076 class="phone s01"><cite>Paul:</cite> lots of the heavy lifting has been done already, but let's get an update<br>
<span id=x077>… we have <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pjbhuj3">http://<wbr>tinyurl.com/<wbr>pjbhuj3</a></span><br>
<span id=x078>… <a href="http://tinyurl.com/o6xb946">http://<wbr>tinyurl.com/<wbr>o6xb946</a></span><br>
<span id=x079>… zero bugs outstanding</span></p>
<p id=x080 class=irc><cite>&lt;paulc&gt;</cite> waves</p>
<p id=x096 class="phone s04"><cite>Mark:</cite> back in september, we looked at the CR document<br>
<span id=x097>… some things were missing</span><br>
<span id=x098>… focus ring and hit region</span><br>
<span id=x099>… focus is critical for keyboard user</span><br>
<span id=x100>… and hit region for a11y api</span><br>
<span id=x101>… so we formed a subgroup</span><br>
<span id=x102>… we made progress on a weekly basis</span><br>
<span id=x103>… we tried to achieve both</span><br>
<span id=x104>… drawFocusIfNeeded</span><br>
<span id=x105>… once we finished that, Mozilla attempted to implement and didn't like the approach</span><br>
<span id=x106>… so we worked ona hit region based solution</span><br>
<span id=x107>… was a rather complicated section of the spec</span><br>
<span id=x108>… Mozilla demonstrated a quick prototype</span><br>
<span id=x109>… we reduced hit regions to something easy to implement</span><br>
<span id=x110>… while maintaining forward compatibility</span><br>
<span id=x111>… and we're in a good shape</span></p>
<p id=x113 class=irc><cite>&lt;paulc&gt;</cite> Open Canvas2D CR Bugs - CR keyword - zero bugs <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pjbhuj3">http://<wbr>tinyurl.com/<wbr>pjbhuj3</a></p>
<p id=x115 class="phone s04"><cite>Mark:</cite> a few clarifications to make, will go over them with Jay today<br>
<span id=x116>… so should be able to move to LC next week</span></p>
<p id=x129 class="phone s01"><cite>Paul:</cite> plan is to take it back to LC<br>
<span id=x130>… 4 weeks</span><br>
<span id=x131>… disclosure is a long pole</span><br>
<span id=x132>… won't be able to move to PR within 60 days</span><br>
<span id=x133>… we don't expect substantive comments on the LC</span><br>
<span id=x134>… current CR had several at risk features</span><br>
<span id=x135>… we got rid of them through a bug</span><br>
<span id=x136>… so adding the hit region material. they have at most one implementation currently. so hit region itself will be at risk.</span><br>
<span id=x137>… otherwise we would be blocked and have to go to LC again to remove it</span><br>
<span id=x138>… it's a standalone section</span><br>
<span id=x139>… Jay and  Mark will give  a stable draft this week</span><br>
<span id=x140>… then we'll do a CfC for LC</span><br>
<span id=x141>… targeting publication on or before April 22</span></p>
<p id=x142 class=irc><cite>&lt;krisk&gt;</cite> * test</p>
<p id=x145 class="phone s01"><cite>Paul:</cite> this means LC ends May 20 or earlier<br>
<span id=x146>… since we won't skip CR, we won't say anything in the status</span><br>
<span id=x147>… on CR length, let's hold for that on the HTML 5 discussion</span></p>
<p id=x148 class=irc><cite>&lt;krisk&gt;</cite> * hint johnjan if you want to talk about webdriver and web platform tests at a certain time</p>
<p id=x152 class="phone s01"><cite>Paul:</cite> most important item is the second implementation for hit region<br>
<span id=x153>… test results</span><br>
<span id=x154>… at a previous HTML Group meeting</span><br>
<span id=x155>… <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/test/results/2dcontext/">http://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>html/<wbr>test/<wbr>results/<wbr>2dcontext/</a></span></p>
<p id=x156 class=irc><cite>&lt;JohnJansen&gt;</cite> I'm on IRC and would like to call in when the test status discussion starts</p>
<p id=x157 class="phone s01"><cite>Paul:</cite> is there a plan to get these test results updated?</p>
<p id=x158 class="phone s02"><cite>Robin:</cite> I can do that</p>
<p id=a01 class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> Robin to provide updated results for Canvas 2D Level 1</p>
<p id=x160 class=bot><cite>&lt;trackbot&gt;</cite> Created ACTION-238 - Provide updated results for canvas 2d level 1 [on Robin Berjon - due 2014-04-15].</p>
<p id=x161 class=summary><a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/tree/master/2dcontext/drawing-paths-to-the-canvas">https://<wbr>github.com/<wbr>w3c/<wbr>web-platform-tests/<wbr>tree/<wbr>master/<wbr>2dcontext/<wbr>drawing-paths-to-the-canvas</a></p>
<p id=x164 class="phone s01"><cite>Paul:</cite> on canvas results, the sense was that we had enough data, modulo hit regions<br>
<span id=x165>… so Robin will just udpate the results</span><br>
<span id=x166>… so only thing on critical path is the second implementation of hit region</span></p>
<p id=x167 class="phone s06"><cite>Glenn:</cite> and if we don't get it?</p>
<p id=x170 class="phone s01"><cite>Paul:</cite> several possibility: extension spec, level 2 only, (I don't think we want to consider dropping it)<br>
<span id=x171>… then criteria will be trade-off between waiting or having the REC</span><br>
<span id=x172>… we'll mark hit regions at risk in the LC and the CR</span></p>

<span id=x176>… bugs are resolved</span></p>
<p id=x178 class="phone s02"><cite>Robin:</cite> initially, I subsetted the DOM WHATWG spec to remove Promises<br>
<span id=x179>… but then it got removed from DOM WHATWG as well, so we're back in sync</span></p>

<span id=x211>… some of the them are disputable</span><br>
<span id=x212>… like historical tests</span><br>

<p id=x334 class="phone s02"><cite>robin:</cite> this document reflects an up to date view of the quality of the test suite</p>
<p id=x335 class="phone s10"><cite>pc:</cite> previous data tells us how we're doing on the tests we have, this one tell us where we need more tests</p>
<p id=x336 class="phone s07"><cite>plh:</cite> this is from april 2013</p>
<p id=x337 class="phone s10"><cite>pc:</cite> these show areas where we needed more coverage.  where do we stand on this</p>
<p id=x338 class="phone s07"><cite>plh:</cite> a year ago we thought we needed more testing, for example for 2.4.5.  The checks say that we now thing we have enough tests.</p>
<p id=x339 class="phone s02"><cite>robin:</cite> no, the green ones are where the group said we didn't need tests.  green + check means we don't need tests but we have them.  purple with check means we need and have tests.</p>
<p id=x340 class="phone s10"><cite>pc:</cite> so I need to look for ones without checkmarks.</p>
<p id=x341 class=summary>3.1.4 loading xml documents is priority, no check, needs tests and doesn't have them.</p>
<p id=x342 class="phone s02"><cite>robin:</cite> in most of these cases, we have pull requests that need reviewing</p>
<p id=x343 class="phone s10"><cite>pc:</cite> that will give us tests, but not results or implemenations</p>
<p id=x344 class="phone s07"><cite>plh:</cite> section 5 is not well tests at all</p>
<p id=x346 class="phone s02"><cite>robin:</cite> for most of these, I think we will be good soon.  loading xml is a feature we're likely to drop.  many others have open pull requests.  section 5 is our weekness</p>
<p id=x347 class="phone s06"><cite>glenn:</cite> a lot of these are new features to html5</p>
<p id=x348 class="phone s02"><cite>robin:</cite> not necesarily</p>

<p id=x350 class="phone s02"><cite>robin:</cite> obviously anything new needs to be tested, but a lot of the purple lines are things where we knew there were historical issues</p>
<p id=x351 class="phone s02"><cite>robin:</cite> section 5 is about the window object.  the rules were never written down before, and everyone does it differently.</p>
<p id=x352 class="phone s07"><cite>plh:</cite> pasted in pull request numbers that are waiting.</p>
<p id=x354 class="phone s10"><cite>pc:</cite> 38 rows that have the word 'priority' in them</p>

<p id=x356 class=irc><cite>&lt;krisk&gt;</cite> 22 of the 38 are in section 5</p>
<p id=x357 class=irc><cite>&lt;plh&gt;</cite> #463</p>
<p id=x358 class="phone s10"><cite>pc:</cite> these 38 rows, we need tests, we need results, and then we need to evaluate the results to see if we have implementations</p>
<p id=x359 class="phone s10"><cite>pc:</cite> so, what are we going to about these? are we going to do anything?</p>
<p id=x360 class="phone s02"><cite>robin:</cite> a number of section 5 items have tests that need reviewing</p>

<p id=x365 class="phone s10"><cite>pc:</cite> do these pull requests decrease the number from 38?</p>
<p id=x366 class="phone s07"><cite>plh:</cite> yes, but not to 0.</p>
<p id=x367 class="phone s07"><cite>plh:</cite> decrease by not more than 30%</p>
<p id=x368 class="phone s10"><cite>pc:</cite> this seems like a high priority item</p>

<p id=x388 class="phone s10"><cite>PC:</cite> with that in mind, we've said: let's remove app cache.</p>
<p id=x389 class="phone s10"><cite>pc:</cite> what do we do with dialog?</p>

<h3 id=t05>DataCue discussion</h3>
<p id=x417 class=irc><cite>&lt;paulc&gt;</cite> We are waiting for Sylvia.</p>
<p id=x420 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> Here is a summary of the proposal<br>
<span id=x421>… it's in the spec section</span><br>
<span id=x422>… 4.7.10.12.6 Test Tracks exposing meta data</span></p>
<p id=x423 class=irc><cite>&lt;hober&gt;</cite> <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/embedded-content.html#datacue">http://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>html/<wbr>wg/<wbr>drafts/<wbr>html/<wbr>master/<wbr>embedded-content.html#datacue</a></p>

<p id=x425 class=irc><cite>&lt;paulc&gt;</cite> 4.7.10.12.6 Text tracks exposing in-band metadata</p>
<p id=x426 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> The idea is that sites streaming media an stream custom metadata</p>
<p id=x427 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> It can be text or custom for the page author</p>
<p id=x428 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> Normally metadata is decoded by the browser(s)</p>
<p id=x429 class=summary>hober; I3 for example has data about the show, or the teams playing and the score</p>
<p id=x430 class="phone s16"><cite>Hober:</cite> We like to be a bit more like xhr where we can expose a document, or blob</p>
<p id=x431 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> we don't want to have then take time to decode the data buffer</p>
<p id=x432 class="phone s06"><cite>glenn:</cite> The generic use and specific should be seperate use cases</p>
<p id=x433 class="phone s06"><cite>glenn:</cite> Having other metadata to help the user agent decode would be good</p>
<p id=x434 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> The first case seems fine, I'm only talking about the latter</p>
<p id=x435 class="phone s17"><cite>mjs:</cite> Does the user agent have a way to determine the data stream?</p>
<p id=x436 class="phone s18"><cite>krisk:</cite> An attribute exists that has this information</p>
<p id=x437 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> basically just change from arraybuffer to any</p>
<p id=x438 class="phone s06"><cite>glenn:</cite> what is raw data?  framing and payload?</p>
<p id=x439 class="phone s06"><cite>glenn:</cite> what if we wanted to expose more than one type?</p>
<p id=x440 class="phone s06"><cite>glenn:</cite> I though .text was kept for backward compat</p>
<p id=x441 class=summary>The current is useful, if it's plain text you need to extract from arraybuffer</p>
<p id=x442 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> data sticks around and replace text?</p>
<p id=x443 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> which version 5.0 or 5.1?</p>
<p id=x444 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> it's in 5.0 4.7.10.12.6</p>
<p id=x445 class="phone s06"><cite>glenn:</cite> It's worth mentioning that the WHATWG doesn't have this at all</p>
<p id=x446 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> The next topic is part of talking about this..</p>
<p id=x447 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> Ian thinks this is useless</p>
<p id=x448 class="phone s06"><cite>glenn:</cite> Unless the useragent knows what it is and can decode this data</p>
<p id=x449 class="phone s07"><cite>plh:</cite> How do you get a DataCue in HTML5 today</p>
<p id=x450 class="phone s06"><cite>glenn:</cite> You need to know that this part of text track queues</p>
<p id=x451 class="phone s06"><cite>glenn:</cite> Using typeOf or the track type itself</p>
<p id=x452 class="phone s17"><cite>mjs:</cite> instanceOf will work</p>
<p id=x453 class="phone s17"><cite>mjs:</cite> It's like getElementById - you need to check or know what type of element that is returned</p>
<p id=x454 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> I wanted to raise the issue and do a sanity check on this issue</p>
<p id=x455 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> what is the elevator pitch?</p>
<p id=x456 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> Add a new field which exposed the encode type</p>
<p id=x458 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> glenn seems ok with replacing .text</p>
<p id=x459 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> we could add some non-normative examples in the spec</p>
<p id=x460 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> I'm open with the name of this</p>
<p id=x461 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> This item text is basically at risk no tests, no implementation</p>
<p id=x463 class=irc><cite>&lt;hober&gt;</cite> WebKit bug: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=123907">https://<wbr>bugs.webkit.org/<wbr>show_bug.cgi?id=123907</a></p>
<p id=x464 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> are we done?</p>
<p id=x465 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> I can have an action item to add a bug for this issue</p>
<p id=x466 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> Next item on Agenda is HTML WG culture and participation and divergence from WHATWG specs</p>

<h3 id=t06>HTML WG culture and participation and divergence from WHATWG specs</h3>
<p id=x468 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> first item is from tantek</p>
<p id=x469 class=summary>second is robins spec diffs</p>
<p id=x470 class=summary>third is the work mode document</p>
<p id=x471 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> Let's start with work mode document</p>
<p id=x474 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> It's been a while since we updated the decision policy<br>
<span id=x475>… a number sections are old, not used</span><br>
<span id=x476>… whatwg has a doc is this a better base for changes?</span></p>
<p id=x477 class=irc><cite>&lt;paulc&gt;</cite> Workmode document: <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/wg/WorkMode">https://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>HTML/<wbr>wg/<wbr>WorkMode</a></p>
<p id=x478 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> I sent this proposal to the list and had only one positive commit</p>
<p id=x479 class=irc><cite>&lt;paulc&gt;</cite> 'Proposal need to suggest one or more editors, be able to identify independent support, be within the scope of the working group, and not attract strong objections&quot;</p>
<p id=x480 class="phone s06"><cite>glenn:</cite> I'd propose removing the second sentance (see above)</p>
<p id=x484 class=summary>It's not removing the second sentance...</p>
<p id=x485 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> Sam and I did a personal rude Q and A</p>
<p id=x486 class=irc><cite>&lt;glenn&gt;</cite> s/the second sentence/the last phrase &quot;and not attract strong objections&quot;/</p>
<p id=x487 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> Like why did we have this in the first place</p>
<p id=x488 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> We'd like to not have this but had to add this in the past to make progress on working group decision</p>
<p id=x489 class=irc><cite>&lt;jaymunro&gt;</cite>  Possible wording:  Proposal need to suggest one or more editors, be able to identify independent support, and be within the scope of the working group.</p>
<p id=x490 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> We'd like to have a lighter weight process, especially in pre-last call and last call</p>
<p id=x491 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> We would like to have the editors do this work and not have this heavy process in place to make progress</p>
<p id=x492 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> If we don't have any objections the chairs are going to impl this change</p>
<p id=x493 class="phone s06"><cite>glenn:</cite> So basically we are going to a lighter weight process and if needed we can handle one off issues</p>
<p id=x494 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> Yes - with the current editiors we have had zero issues</p>
<p id=x495 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> the extension specs seem to have helped as well since it has taken pressure off and exists to get changes made to the spec for alternate solutions</p>
<p id=x498 class="phone s06"><cite>glenn:</cite> quesiton about extension specs...<br>
<span id=x499>… would we move items at risk into an extension spec?</span></p>
<p id=x501 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> ruby got moved into 5.0 from an extension spec</p>
<p id=x502 class="phone s06"><cite>glenn:</cite> my ask is the opposite - remove feature and move to an extension spec</p>
<p id=x503 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> Yes if it can be cleanly removed  - canvas 2d hit testing is an example</p>
<p id=x505 class=irc><cite>&lt;Zakim&gt;</cite> MarkS, you wanted to ask what differentiates sections with a priority flag and without</p>
<p id=x507 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> One having a light process is much better</p>
<p id=x508 class=irc><cite>&lt;gitbot&gt;</cite> [13html] 15darobin pushed 1 new commit to 06gh-pages: 02<a href="https://github.com/w3c/html/commit/f4eda02f5c9456aa2045b21353889bd9bef3a385">https://<wbr>github.com/<wbr>w3c/<wbr>html/<wbr>commit/<wbr>f4eda02f5c9456aa2045b21353889bd9bef3a385</a></p>
<p id=x509 class=irc><cite>&lt;gitbot&gt;</cite> 13html/06gh-pages 14f4eda02 15Robin Berjon: updated safari results</p>
<p id=x511 class=summary>Though for the 1% having a process in place is helpful</p>
<p id=x512 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> I understand this point - other WG have this 1% issue, but so far this has not been the case</p>
<p id=x516 class=irc><cite>&lt;MikeSmith&gt;</cite> for the sake of being accurate here, the &quot;original problem&quot; really hasn't been solved. The problem that Hixie mentioned here just earlier here remains. Unless we somehow don't consider that a problem.</p>
<p id=x517 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> Seem that one needs to just escalate to the chairs like in other working groups</p>
<p id=x518 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> Or higher if needed</p>
<p id=x519 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> Art asked the chairs why we were doing CFC for heartbeat drafts for example</p>
<p id=x520 class="phone s02"><cite>robin:</cite> moving this into the wiki woudl be good and keeping the work mode short is very helpful for new commers</p>
<p id=x521 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> New person comment is realy helpful since it will help people feel more welcome working/joining the group</p>
<p id=x522 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> The previous policy had the effect of turning people away from the HTML WG</p>
<p id=x523 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> This seems to undo some of this damage and better by moving to a wiki</p>
<p id=x526 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> That was one of our objections</p>
<p id=x527 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> We started to look at this after TPAC from feedback and now have this change in place for approval</p>
<p id=x528 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> If the group decides to copy move specs from whatwg we should try to minimize divergence</p>
<p id=x529 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> Keeping track of just the diffs is not enough</p>
<p id=x530 class=irc><cite>&lt;Hixie&gt;</cite> or, you know, the wg could STOP COPYING OUR WORK in the first place</p>
<p id=x531 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> The charter calls out that we can take work from other sources</p>
<p id=x535 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> Glenn made a suggestion - he should update the wiki</p>
<p id=x537 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> We were talking about how the previous work mode came about from the failure mode we had at that time</p>
<p id=x538 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> The opposite case is that editor has captured the consensus of the group, but one still objects</p>
<p id=x539 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> The new document, talks about potentially changing the editor</p>
<p id=x541 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> We should maybe protect the group from a DoS</p>
<p id=x542 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> It's possible to do this and needs to be done with extreem care</p>
<p id=x543 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> so we do have a way to protect the group from a DoS (both sides of the problem)</p>
<p id=x544 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> In the Ally TF we have had chairs attend this meeting to make sure all parties are being heard</p>
<p id=x547 class=irc><cite>&lt;Zakim&gt;</cite> MikeSmith, you wanted to point out that the decision about whether to copy specs from the WHATWG at all is ultimately an HTML WG decision, not some kind of unchangeable external requirement</p>
<p id=x549 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> Having a personal touch and not process is ideal</p>
<p id=x550 class=irc><cite>&lt;Hixie&gt;</cite> maybe that diff should instead just say &quot;Editors of documents that have an independent existence outside of the working group SHOULD NOT exist&quot;</p>
<p id=x557 class="phone s21"><cite>mikesmith:</cite> I wanted to make the point that we have been talking around the issue..<br>
<span id=x558>… it's possible that we have an upstream spec under a diff license</span><br>
<span id=x559>… one that says you can republish, modify</span><br>
<span id=x560>… then we would not have this luxury</span><br>
<span id=x561>… so wanted to mention this that the circumstance we are in are not written in stone</span></p>
<p id=x563 class=irc><cite>&lt;Zakim&gt;</cite> tantek, you wanted to discuss one way convergence</p>
<p id=x567 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> rubys: made a point that I wanted to follow up on.<br>
<span id=x568>… tantek we are stuck with the w3c license to possible change</span><br>
<span id=x569>… the ab is working on this and is being worked on</span><br>
<span id=x570>… it's also published on the AB wiki as well</span></p>
<p id=x572 class=irc><cite>&lt;Zakim&gt;</cite> darobin, you wanted to bring up deforking</p>
<p id=x577 class="phone s02"><cite>robin:</cite> we are moving to a new work mode and trying to faciliate document convergence<br>
<span id=x578>… editors talked (minus travis - he is on vacation)</span><br>
<span id=x579>… we wanted to re-visit some possible forks</span><br>
<span id=x580>… in case when a single person was the source and is no longer participating</span><br>
<span id=x581>… which would potentially unfork these parts of the spec</span></p>
<p id=x582 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> 5.0 or 5.1?</p>
<p id=x583 class="phone s02"><cite>robin:</cite> 5.0</p>
<p id=x584 class="phone s02"><cite>robin:</cite> it's alot of small tiny items</p>
<p id=x585 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> The smaller the list looks the better</p>
<p id=x586 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> I'm worried about the schedule - 5.1 seems much safer in terms of risk</p>
<p id=x587 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> 2014 has alot of pressure</p>
<p id=x588 class="phone s02"><cite>robin:</cite> It's not just the chairs</p>
<p id=x589 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> I agree with sam that doing this for 5.0 seems dangerous</p>
<p id=x590 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> I think 5.1 is better, it's been a long time since w3c published a html spec</p>
<p id=x591 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> I encourage the editors to do this on the list</p>
<p id=x592 class="phone s02"><cite>robin:</cite> fair enough as long as we get to do this</p>
<p id=x593 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> The new work mode really opens this up for the editors</p>
<p id=x596 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> last call comments can be made by anyone - including the editors<br>
<span id=x597>… if you see easy ones that have new information the seems reasonable for last call</span></p>
<p id=x599 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> I no longer need to be on the queue</p>
<p id=x602 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> Doing the human to human connection<br>
<span id=x603>… is the right approach as paul mentioned</span></p>
<p id=x604 class="phone s22"><cite>Eliot:</cite> what about the twitter account? Should we use it more?</p>
<p id=x605 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> I'd suggest you give the 'keys' to the chairs</p>
<p id=x606 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> would having the chairs use this be helpful?</p>
<p id=x607 class=summary>group - yes, good oppertunity for w3c</p>
<p id=x608 class=irc><cite>&lt;Hixie&gt;</cite> so... have the chairs even acknowledged that they should consider not copying another group's work? or has the discussion moved on to something else without the topic being discussed?</p>
<p id=x609 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> Group has agreed to move to this new work mode</p>
<p id=x610 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> At minimum we should cite where it comes from</p>
<p id=x611 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> we should be explicit</p>
<p id=x612 class=irc><cite>&lt;Hixie&gt;</cite> if the source doesn't want the text to be copied, that doesn't seem like the minimum.</p>
<p id=x613 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> Two very big diffs in work mode exists - living spec vs w3c mode</p>
<p id=x617 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> html5.0 and html5.1 is different than the living standard do to the diff work modes</p>
<p id=x622 class="phone s23"><cite>marks:</cite> How do you feel we are doing with canvas?  We know of differences and have action items to follow up.</p>
<p id=x624 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> As others mentioned we have the constrains we are bound to work in..<br>
<span id=x625>… In the case of canvas I would have recommend to use the extension spec process</span></p>

<p id=x633 class="phone s23"><cite>marks:</cite> 4 weeks</p>
<p id=x634 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> and you do have tests as well</p>
<p id=x635 class="phone s22"><cite>eliot:</cite> we have no bug but no test cases</p>
<p id=x636 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> we need a list of items that need to enter CR</p>
<p id=x637 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> I would think a list of items at risk and a list of tests to create so that multiple browsers pass each test</p>
<p id=x639 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> seems like the chairs just need to continue work with the editors on timeframes for each</p>

<h3 id=t08>HTML 5.1</h3>
<p id=x689 class=irc><cite>&lt;paulc_&gt;</cite> The status of the ARIA in HTML work is under discussion in A11Y TF</p>
<p id=x690 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> First of is list of bugs - we have 235 bugs</p>
<p id=x691 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> Most of these have not been touched, as we have been pushing for CR</p>
<p id=x692 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> Have you looked to see if any of these are potentially for HTML5.0? Maybe editorial quick wins</p>
<p id=x693 class=summary><a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/buglist.cgi?bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;component=HTML5%20spec&amp;list_id=32878&amp;product=HTML%20WG">Link</a></p>

<p id=x695 class=irc><cite>&lt;paulc_&gt;</cite> HTMl 5.1 Last Call:          2014 Q3</p>
<p id=x696 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> When we have shipped 5.0 - we can tidy up and then look for items that are implemented</p>
<p id=x697 class=irc><cite>&lt;paulc_&gt;</cite> HTML 5.0 LCf:  2014 Q3</p>
<p id=x699 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> so that we have one source document and just remove items that are not stable is the optimal work mode<br>
<span id=x700>… shipping once a year would be my ideal schedule</span></p>
<p id=x701 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> working back on the dates would be intresting</p>
<p id=x704 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> I would hope for a .1 would not need 2 years<br>
<span id=x705>… we have a bunch of items in place that should help shorted CR periods</span><br>
<span id=x706>… even if we only have a few features</span></p>
<p id=x707 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> Maybe late 2015 early 2016</p>
<p id=x708 class="phone s07"><cite>plh:</cite> what does it mean for CR, last call dates, etc...</p>
<p id=x710 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> in theory by then cr and lc will be merged so it'll be lcr which is shorter</p>
<p id=x711 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> Maybe late October we enter lcr?</p>
<p id=x712 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> Can we update the early deliverable on LC for HTMl5.1 by Q3 2014</p>
<p id=x713 class=summary>Is it reasonable to shift focus later in summer to attack 5.1 (bugs) once other specs have progressed?</p>
<p id=x715 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> The goal was that HTMl5.1 would show progress when HTML5 ships<br>
<span id=x716>… in 2014</span></p>
<p id=x717 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> It makes sense to show progress on 5.1 when 5.0 ships..</p>
<p id=x718 class=summary>I think the Q3 2014 for LC for 5.1<br>
<span id=x719>… knowning that their is alot more features in 5.1 and the LCR time dates are smaller</span></p>
<p id=x721 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> I would say Q2 2015 and skip CR so that rec occurs in Q4 2015</p>
<p id=x722 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> since the plan should be to just remove items that are not implemented</p>
<p id=x723 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> So then we need to start a 5.2 then right?</p>
<p id=x724 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> yes</p>
<p id=x725 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> I really think this removes pressure, for items at risk if we get into a yearly schedule</p>
<p id=x726 class=irc><cite>&lt;adrianba&gt;</cite> +1</p>
<p id=x727 class=summary>+2</p>
<p id=x728 class="phone s07"><cite>plh:</cite> the charter ends at june 2015</p>
<p id=x729 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> I think this will not be an issue</p>
<p id=x730 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> I was thinking about how we communicate the changes</p>
<p id=x731 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> we don't have to update the charter, but we do need to inform the AC</p>
<p id=x732 class=irc><cite>&lt;paulc_&gt;</cite> Current schedule is in the charter: <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/03/HTML-WG-charter.html">http://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>2007/<wbr>03/<wbr>HTML-WG-charter.html</a></p>
<p id=x733 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> Then we should communicate LC for 5.1 won't happen in Q3 and that we are going to ship HTML5.1 earlier</p>
<p id=x734 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> Editors should start to think about a date for 5.2 bugs</p>
<p id=x735 class="phone s25"><cite>darobins:</cite> we can actually use the milestone field in bugzilla :)</p>
<p id=x736 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> Getting this list of bug and plan is important, especially with all the 5.0 work</p>
<p id=x737 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> I don't think it's reasonable to work on this until HTML5 gets to PR (can't speak about other editors)</p>
<p id=x738 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> maybe other editors can work on 5.1 bugs</p>
<p id=x739 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> that seems reasonable</p>
<p id=x741 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> do we know the AB schedule for section 7 in the process document and when it will come into effect</p>
<p id=x742 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> Let me ask two qs</p>
<p id=x746 class=irc><cite>&lt;tantek&gt;</cite> Process improvement project: <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Process">https://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>Process</a></p>
<p id=x747 class=summary>In 5.0 we needed to go to no just last call, but pre-last call</p>
<p id=x748 class=summary>Do we think we will need this for 5.1?</p>
<p id=x749 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> so are we ok that 5.0 is marching to be done...</p>
<p id=x750 class=summary>we are just really asking for a review for 5.1 which is much smaller in scope than 5.0<br>
<span id=x751>… so that the model for 5.1 can be much differenet</span></p>
<p id=x753 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> yes</p>
<p id=x754 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> I think it's key to communicate this diff</p>
<p id=x755 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> Next is that I think the ally focus are thinking the 5.1 timeframe will be the same as 5.0</p>
<p id=x756 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> basically we have to communicate this outside an inside the group</p>
<p id=x757 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> In theory if we do ship yearly then it should not be problem, like other 'at risk features'</p>
<p id=x759 class=summary>* krisk_ says goodbye to krisk</p>
<p id=x760 class=irc><cite>&lt;plh&gt;</cite> <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-w3process/2014Mar/0019.html">http://<wbr>lists.w3.org/<wbr>Archives/<wbr>Public/<wbr>public-w3process/<wbr>2014Mar/<wbr>0019.html</a></p>
<p id=x761 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> that is my point, maybe do a paln 2016</p>
<p id=x762 class=irc><cite>&lt;rubys&gt;</cite> d/plan/plan/</p>
<p id=x765 class="phone s07"><cite>plh:</cite> we can use new process if we are not in last call...<br>
<span id=x766>… if you are in last call then you can't use the new process</span></p>
<p id=x769 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> the only spec that this could impact I *think* is EME</p>
<p id=x771 class=irc><cite>&lt;Zakim&gt;</cite> tantek, you wanted to ask why are people considering &quot;5.1 timeframe&quot; for new features? not a good framing. new specs/features should go in extension specs which have their own timelines.</p>
<p id=x773 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> I was confused about extension specs and 5.1</p>
<p id=x774 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> you should read the ally TF work</p>
<p id=x775 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> I think they are really looking at 5.0 in 2014 and then 5.1 2016</p>
<p id=x776 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> I'm all for lining up to other schedules, though it goes against the spirt of extension specs</p>
<p id=x779 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> The api mapping document pre-dates the concept of extension specs</p>
<p id=x786 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> Their is a very human aspect to this...<br>
<span id=x787>… other people want to work with us and we should reach out</span><br>
<span id=x788>… I think the main purpose of this discusion was to get an idea on the schedule - 2016 may not make sense, or that we can get some agreement about moving to a new yearly schedule</span><br>
<span id=x789>… which will lead to a set of action items where stuff can land  - 5.1, 5.2 etc..</span></p>
<p id=x793 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> did your point get covered?</p>
<p id=x794 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> I think so and it's matter of communicating and moving forward</p>
<p id=x796 class="phone s23"><cite>marks:</cite> This really is not an extension spec, it's a series of documents one of which involves HTML, with a core spec published by PF,</p>
<p id=x797 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> I'm trying to decouple the labels - 5.1, 5.2, 5.005 and focus on the date</p>
<p id=x798 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> when we revist at risk features tomorrow we should leverage this as well</p>
<p id=x799 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> Do you think the json spec would rolled in or stay seperate</p>
<p id=x801 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> If a feature doesn't need to be in the main spec, especially if it has no other dependancies</p>
<p id=x802 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> so with JSON it should be seperate</p>
<p id=x803 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> The next item in topic is ally wishlist</p>
<p id=x804 class=summary><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/HTML/wiki/51wishlist">http://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>WAI/<wbr>PF/<wbr>HTML/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>51wishlist</a></p>
<p id=x805 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> I think we need to talk about the content editable and the 5.1 timeframe</p>
<p id=x806 class=summary>* br vs div vs p tag?</p>
<p id=x807 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> OK we can get 15 to talk about tomorrow</p>
<p id=x808 class=irc><cite>&lt;adrianba&gt;</cite> Extensible Web Summit home page: <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/extensible-web-summit/">http://<wbr>lanyrd.com/<wbr>2014/<wbr>extensible-web-summit/</a></p>
<p id=x809 class="phone s07"><cite>plh:</cite> some are not part of HTML</p>
<p id=x811 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> having more details (use case) would be very helpful...not picking oh Haptic output,<br>
<span id=x812>… it's just that it doesn't have info on what exists today and where it fails, etc..</span></p>
<p id=x813 class="phone s26"><cite>cynthia:</cite> menu has issue(s)</p>
<p id=x814 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> details and summary are just missing implementations</p>
<p id=x815 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> yes it's not about the spec, or if we have tests, just not enough implementation</p>
<p id=x816 class="phone s23"><cite>marks:</cite> This is not a complete list and indeed needs more refinement</p>
<p id=x817 class="phone s26"><cite>cynthia:</cite> content editable has accessibility issue</p>
<p id=x818 class="phone s07"><cite>plh:</cite> yes content editable needs work</p>
<p id=x819 class="phone s23"><cite>marks:</cite> I'll update the wish list with some details and use cases</p>
<p id=x820 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> thanks</p>

<h3 id=t09>Datetime input timezone issues</h3>
<p id=x822 class=summary>travil won't be able to discuss due to being on vacation (previously planned)</p>
<p id=x823 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> Is this about 5.0?</p>
<p id=x824 class=summary>bug 16597</p>
<p id=x825 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> has this been fixed in 5.0?</p>
<p id=x826 class=irc><cite>&lt;paulc_&gt;</cite> <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=16957">https://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>Bugs/<wbr>Public/<wbr>show_bug.cgi?id=16957</a></p>
<p id=x827 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> yes it has been moved to 5.0</p>
<p id=x828 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> note the keyword 'CR' - it means it was fixed in the 5.0 CR</p>
<p id=x829 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> What is health warning?</p>
<p id=x830 class=irc><cite>&lt;paulc_&gt;</cite> See <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=16957#c6">https://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>Bugs/<wbr>Public/<wbr>show_bug.cgi?id=16957#c6</a> for Travis's comment about resolving this in 5.0</p>
<p id=x831 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> Basically is you use this input you might mess up...it's not normative</p>
<p id=x832 class=summary>next bug is 16959</p>
<p id=x833 class=irc><cite>&lt;paulc_&gt;</cite> <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=16959">https://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>Bugs/<wbr>Public/<wbr>show_bug.cgi?id=16959</a></p>
<p id=x834 class=summary>* I was about to paste that in paul :)</p>
<p id=x835 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> Is this in 5.0?</p>
<p id=x836 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> Me too since it had the CR removed</p>
<p id=x837 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> why is it still open, it looks like the change was made and intl is happy?</p>
<p id=x838 class="phone s27"><cite>edoyle:</cite> Kept open since it was part of the F2F</p>
<p id=x840 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> It raised the flag since it seems to have diverged?</p>
<p id=x841 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> maybe not an issue if it has not been implemented</p>
<p id=x842 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> what is the current status of datetime input types with this bug</p>
<p id=x843 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> Whatever the path is forward drop datetime-local, or has same functionality as datetime gets in back in sync</p>
<p id=x844 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> since this bug was just fixed, but was last talked about in june 2013</p>
<p id=x845 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> is the simple issue just change local to floating?</p>
<p id=x849 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> seems like this is confusing enough to drop for 5.0</p>
<p id=x850 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> Only pre-blink Opera has support for input type=datetime</p>
<p id=x852 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> Then indeed we should remove from 5.0</p>
<p id=x853 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> this is on the at risk list already</p>
<p id=x854 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> yes we will discuss tomorrow</p>
<p id=x855 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> darobin can you do quick check what changes have been made?</p>
<p id=x856 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> The bug(s) has links to the diffs</p>
<p id=x857 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> No real reason to worry about these bugs since indeed the whole section is at risk to be removed</p>
<p id=x858 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> The other reason was that it touches on two items...</p>
<p id=x859 class=summary>one if this was actually well implemented we would have a big issue<br>
<span id=x860>… it raises the issue of new features that have no implemetations</span><br>
<span id=x861>… it could be that the idea is bad and the group could propose a different solution</span><br>
<span id=x862>… for example a extentsion spec that gets implementations</span></p>

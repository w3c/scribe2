<h3 id=5aa4>Canvas 2D Level 1</h3>
<p id=7307 class="phone s01"><cite>Paul:</cite> lots of the heavy lifting has been done already, but let's get an update<br>
<span id=2293>… we have <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pjbhuj3">http://<wbr>tinyurl.com/<wbr>pjbhuj3</a></span><br>
<span id=81fd>… <a href="http://tinyurl.com/o6xb946">http://<wbr>tinyurl.com/<wbr>o6xb946</a></span><br>
<span id=8265>… zero bugs outstanding</span></p>
<p id=fea4 class=irc><cite>&lt;paulc&gt;</cite> waves</p>
<p id=e71f class="phone s04"><cite>Mark:</cite> back in september, we looked at the CR document<br>
<span id=e36f>… some things were missing</span><br>
<span id=254c>… focus ring and hit region</span><br>
<span id=07fc>… focus is critical for keyboard user</span><br>
<span id=5b2a>… and hit region for a11y api</span><br>
<span id=0124>… so we formed a subgroup</span><br>
<span id=5a15>… we made progress on a weekly basis</span><br>
<span id=3d88>… we tried to achieve both</span><br>
<span id=2b0a>… drawFocusIfNeeded</span><br>
<span id=ffff>… once we finished that, Mozilla attempted to implement and didn't like the approach</span><br>
<span id=e734>… so we worked ona hit region based solution</span><br>
<span id=fdeb>… was a rather complicated section of the spec</span><br>
<span id=4721>… Mozilla demonstrated a quick prototype</span><br>
<span id=73db>… we reduced hit regions to something easy to implement</span><br>
<span id=d558>… while maintaining forward compatibility</span><br>
<span id=d6a0>… and we're in a good shape</span></p>
<p id=2786 class=irc><cite>&lt;paulc&gt;</cite> Open Canvas2D CR Bugs - CR keyword - zero bugs <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pjbhuj3">http://<wbr>tinyurl.com/<wbr>pjbhuj3</a></p>
<p id=5648 class="phone s04"><cite>Mark:</cite> a few clarifications to make, will go over them with Jay today<br>
<span id=140e>… so should be able to move to LC next week</span></p>
<p id=6d71 class="phone s01"><cite>Paul:</cite> plan is to take it back to LC<br>
<span id=60e9>… 4 weeks</span><br>
<span id=9993>… disclosure is a long pole</span><br>
<span id=adc5>… won't be able to move to PR within 60 days</span><br>
<span id=e86b>… we don't expect substantive comments on the LC</span><br>
<span id=3237>… current CR had several at risk features</span><br>
<span id=79c3>… we got rid of them through a bug</span><br>
<span id=87c4>… so adding the hit region material. they have at most one implementation currently. so hit region itself will be at risk.</span><br>
<span id=b8fc>… otherwise we would be blocked and have to go to LC again to remove it</span><br>
<span id=7995>… it's a standalone section</span><br>
<span id=6d1d>… Jay and  Mark will give  a stable draft this week</span><br>
<span id=6678>… then we'll do a CfC for LC</span><br>
<span id=e1b0>… targeting publication on or before April 22</span></p>
<p id=ae1f class=irc><cite>&lt;krisk&gt;</cite> * test</p>
<p id=0dec class="phone s01"><cite>Paul:</cite> this means LC ends May 20 or earlier<br>
<span id=e77a>… since we won't skip CR, we won't say anything in the status</span><br>
<span id=9a9c>… on CR length, let's hold for that on the HTML 5 discussion</span></p>
<p id=b180 class=irc><cite>&lt;krisk&gt;</cite> * hint johnjan if you want to talk about webdriver and web platform tests at a certain time</p>
<p id=ee97 class="phone s01"><cite>Paul:</cite> most important item is the second implementation for hit region<br>
<span id=d731>… test results</span><br>
<span id=72e2>… at a previous HTML Group meeting</span><br>
<span id=e507>… <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/test/results/2dcontext/">http://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>html/<wbr>test/<wbr>results/<wbr>2dcontext/</a></span></p>
<p id=2e58 class=irc><cite>&lt;JohnJansen&gt;</cite> I'm on IRC and would like to call in when the test status discussion starts</p>
<p id=74a5 class="phone s01"><cite>Paul:</cite> is there a plan to get these test results updated?</p>
<p id=b0f3 class="phone s02"><cite>Robin:</cite> I can do that</p>
<p id=afbe class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> Robin to provide updated results for Canvas 2D Level 1</p>
<p id=5638 class=bot><cite>&lt;trackbot&gt;</cite> Created ACTION-238 - Provide updated results for canvas 2d level 1 [on Robin Berjon - due 2014-04-15].</p>
<p id=fcba class=summary><a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/tree/master/2dcontext/drawing-paths-to-the-canvas">https://<wbr>github.com/<wbr>w3c/<wbr>web-platform-tests/<wbr>tree/<wbr>master/<wbr>2dcontext/<wbr>drawing-paths-to-the-canvas</a></p>
<p id=7960 class="phone s01"><cite>Paul:</cite> on canvas results, the sense was that we had enough data, modulo hit regions<br>
<span id=8c92>… so Robin will just udpate the results</span><br>
<span id=3114>… so only thing on critical path is the second implementation of hit region</span></p>
<p id=b0f9 class="phone s06"><cite>Glenn:</cite> and if we don't get it?</p>
<p id=a1b7 class="phone s01"><cite>Paul:</cite> several possibility: extension spec, level 2 only, (I don't think we want to consider dropping it)<br>
<span id=9460>… then criteria will be trade-off between waiting or having the REC</span><br>
<span id=c9ba>… we'll mark hit regions at risk in the LC and the CR</span></p>

<span id=e37c>… bugs are resolved</span></p>
<p id=4b72 class="phone s02"><cite>Robin:</cite> initially, I subsetted the DOM WHATWG spec to remove Promises<br>
<span id=0082>… but then it got removed from DOM WHATWG as well, so we're back in sync</span></p>

<span id=c96d>… some of the them are disputable</span><br>
<span id=4ce0>… like historical tests</span><br>

<p id=810c class="phone s10"><cite>pc:</cite> previous data tells us how we're doing on the tests we have, this one tell us where we need more tests</p>
<p id=e2cc class="phone s07"><cite>plh:</cite> this is from april 2013</p>

<p id=d981 class="phone s02"><cite>robin:</cite> no, the green ones are where the group said we didn't need tests.  green + check means we don't need tests but we have them.  purple with check means we need and have tests.</p>

<p id=4c06 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> The idea is that sites streaming media an stream custom metadata</p>
<p id=a3aa class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> It can be text or custom for the page author</p>
<p id=cd44 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> Normally metadata is decoded by the browser(s)</p>

<p id=dbad class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> I sent this proposal to the list and had only one positive commit</p>

<p id=135d class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> Like why did we have this in the first place</p>
<p id=defa class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> We'd like to not have this but had to add this in the past to make progress on working group decision</p>
<p id=c4dc class=irc><cite>&lt;jaymunro&gt;</cite>  Possible wording:  Proposal need to suggest one or more editors, be able to identify independent support, and be within the scope of the working group.</p>
<p id=1b7d class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> We'd like to have a lighter weight process, especially in pre-last call and last call</p>
<p id=3125 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> We would like to have the editors do this work and not have this heavy process in place to make progress</p>
<p id=22f3 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> If we don't have any objections the chairs are going to impl this change</p>
<p id=568d class="phone s06"><cite>glenn:</cite> So basically we are going to a lighter weight process and if needed we can handle one off issues</p>
<p id=28db class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> Yes - with the current editiors we have had zero issues</p>
<p id=0cb0 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> the extension specs seem to have helped as well since it has taken pressure off and exists to get changes made to the spec for alternate solutions</p>
<p id=ae34 class="phone s06"><cite>glenn:</cite> quesiton about extension specs...<br>
<span id=c34a>… would we move items at risk into an extension spec?</span></p>
<p id=86bc class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> ruby got moved into 5.0 from an extension spec</p>
<p id=fcbd class="phone s06"><cite>glenn:</cite> my ask is the opposite - remove feature and move to an extension spec</p>
<p id=f11a class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> Yes if it can be cleanly removed  - canvas 2d hit testing is an example</p>
<p id=432e class=irc><cite>&lt;Zakim&gt;</cite> MarkS, you wanted to ask what differentiates sections with a priority flag and without</p>
<p id=4c82 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> One having a light process is much better</p>

<p id=c31a class=summary>Though for the 1% having a process in place is helpful</p>
<p id=6faf class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> I understand this point - other WG have this 1% issue, but so far this has not been the case</p>
<p id=a201 class=irc><cite>&lt;MikeSmith&gt;</cite> for the sake of being accurate here, the &quot;original problem&quot; really hasn't been solved. The problem that Hixie mentioned here just earlier here remains. Unless we somehow don't consider that a problem.</p>
<p id=c7dd class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> Seem that one needs to just escalate to the chairs like in other working groups</p>
<p id=5592 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> Or higher if needed</p>
<p id=0071 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> Art asked the chairs why we were doing CFC for heartbeat drafts for example</p>
<p id=8c29 class="phone s02"><cite>robin:</cite> moving this into the wiki woudl be good and keeping the work mode short is very helpful for new commers</p>
<p id=77bf class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> New person comment is realy helpful since it will help people feel more welcome working/joining the group</p>
<p id=3d8a class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> The previous policy had the effect of turning people away from the HTML WG</p>
<p id=2adb class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> This seems to undo some of this damage and better by moving to a wiki</p>
<p id=575e class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> That was one of our objections</p>
<p id=e572 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> We started to look at this after TPAC from feedback and now have this change in place for approval</p>
<p id=d042 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> If the group decides to copy move specs from whatwg we should try to minimize divergence</p>
<p id=6e57 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> Keeping track of just the diffs is not enough</p>
<p id=a807 class=irc><cite>&lt;Hixie&gt;</cite> or, you know, the wg could STOP COPYING OUR WORK in the first place</p>
<p id=35cf class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> The charter calls out that we can take work from other sources</p>
<p id=b0e3 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> Glenn made a suggestion - he should update the wiki</p>
<p id=8c17 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> We were talking about how the previous work mode came about from the failure mode we had at that time</p>
<p id=789a class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> The opposite case is that editor has captured the consensus of the group, but one still objects</p>
<p id=aa88 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> The new document, talks about potentially changing the editor</p>
<p id=bca4 class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> We should maybe protect the group from a DoS</p>
<p id=2109 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> It's possible to do this and needs to be done with extreem care</p>
<p id=6f9f class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> so we do have a way to protect the group from a DoS (both sides of the problem)</p>
<p id=82c9 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> In the Ally TF we have had chairs attend this meeting to make sure all parties are being heard</p>
<p id=33b9 class=irc><cite>&lt;Zakim&gt;</cite> MikeSmith, you wanted to point out that the decision about whether to copy specs from the WHATWG at all is ultimately an HTML WG decision, not some kind of unchangeable external requirement</p>
<p id=309e class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> Having a personal touch and not process is ideal</p>
<p id=b880 class=irc><cite>&lt;Hixie&gt;</cite> maybe that diff should instead just say &quot;Editors of documents that have an independent existence outside of the working group SHOULD NOT exist&quot;</p>
<p id=84fd class="phone s21"><cite>mikesmith:</cite> I wanted to make the point that we have been talking around the issue..<br>

<span id=e5b9>… then we would not have this luxury</span><br>

<p id=eb54 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> I'm worried about the schedule - 5.1 seems much safer in terms of risk</p>

<p id=b659 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> I encourage the editors to do this on the list</p>
<p id=ab0f class="phone s02"><cite>robin:</cite> fair enough as long as we get to do this</p>
<p id=a06e class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> The new work mode really opens this up for the editors</p>
<p id=13de class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> last call comments can be made by anyone - including the editors<br>

<p id=af0c class=irc><cite>&lt;Hixie&gt;</cite> so... have the chairs even acknowledged that they should consider not copying another group's work? or has the discussion moved on to something else without the topic being discussed?</p>
<p id=1e84 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> Group has agreed to move to this new work mode</p>
<p id=4afa class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> At minimum we should cite where it comes from</p>

<p id=2e3e class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> so that we have one source document and just remove items that are not stable is the optimal work mode<br>
<span id=e290>… shipping once a year would be my ideal schedule</span></p>
<p id=10001 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> working back on the dates would be intresting</p>
<p id=a0ad class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> I would hope for a .1 would not need 2 years<br>
<span id=ddcd>… we have a bunch of items in place that should help shorted CR periods</span><br>
<span id=0b00>… even if we only have a few features</span></p>
<p id=bea8 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> Maybe late 2015 early 2016</p>
<p id=e26d class="phone s07"><cite>plh:</cite> what does it mean for CR, last call dates, etc...</p>
<p id=13e0 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> in theory by then cr and lc will be merged so it'll be lcr which is shorter</p>
<p id=91ae class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> Maybe late October we enter lcr?</p>
<p id=3a92 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> Can we update the early deliverable on LC for HTMl5.1 by Q3 2014</p>
<p id=51b6 class=summary>Is it reasonable to shift focus later in summer to attack 5.1 (bugs) once other specs have progressed?</p>
<p id=8d20 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> The goal was that HTMl5.1 would show progress when HTML5 ships<br>
<span id=220c>… in 2014</span></p>
<p id=cd90 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> It makes sense to show progress on 5.1 when 5.0 ships..</p>
<p id=5b97 class=summary>I think the Q3 2014 for LC for 5.1<br>
<span id=f4a0>… knowning that their is alot more features in 5.1 and the LCR time dates are smaller</span></p>
<p id=7073 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> I would say Q2 2015 and skip CR so that rec occurs in Q4 2015</p>
<p id=9a9b class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> since the plan should be to just remove items that are not implemented</p>
<p id=d202 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> So then we need to start a 5.2 then right?</p>
<p id=ba03 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> yes</p>
<p id=13f0 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> I really think this removes pressure, for items at risk if we get into a yearly schedule</p>

<p id=013f class=irc><cite>&lt;krisk&gt;</cite> +2</p>
<p id=67a1 class="phone s07"><cite>plh:</cite> the charter ends at june 2015</p>
<p id=5823 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> I think this will not be an issue</p>
<p id=aed8 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> I was thinking about how we communicate the changes</p>
<p id=10002 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> we don't have to update the charter, but we do need to inform the AC</p>
<p id=8128 class=irc><cite>&lt;paulc_&gt;</cite> Current schedule is in the charter: <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/03/HTML-WG-charter.html">http://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>2007/<wbr>03/<wbr>HTML-WG-charter.html</a></p>
<p id=e9b5 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> Then we should communicate LC for 5.1 won't happen in Q3 and that we are going to ship HTML5.1 earlier</p>
<p id=291d class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> Editors should start to think about a date for 5.2 bugs</p>
<p id=cb4b class="phone s25"><cite>darobins:</cite> we can actually use the milestone field in bugzilla :)</p>
<p id=6ef8 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> Getting this list of bug and plan is important, especially with all the 5.0 work</p>
<p id=35f5 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> I don't think it's reasonable to work on this until HTML5 gets to PR (can't speak about other editors)</p>
<p id=a398 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> maybe other editors can work on 5.1 bugs</p>
<p id=2a5b class="phone s16"><cite>hober:</cite> that seems reasonable</p>
<p id=1d82 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> do we know the AB schedule for section 7 in the process document and when it will come into effect</p>
<p id=7799 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> Let me ask two qs</p>
<p id=7e2d class=irc><cite>&lt;tantek&gt;</cite> Process improvement project: <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Process">https://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>Process</a></p>
<p id=e26e class=summary>In 5.0 we needed to go to no just last call, but pre-last call</p>
<p id=481b class=summary>Do we think we will need this for 5.1?</p>
<p id=f8ef class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> so are we ok that 5.0 is marching to be done...</p>
<p id=4da5 class=summary>we are just really asking for a review for 5.1 which is much smaller in scope than 5.0<br>
<span id=9002>… so that the model for 5.1 can be much differenet</span></p>
<p id=e4db class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> yes</p>
<p id=55ce class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> I think it's key to communicate this diff</p>
<p id=609c class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> Next is that I think the ally focus are thinking the 5.1 timeframe will be the same as 5.0</p>
<p id=4b19 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> basically we have to communicate this outside an inside the group</p>
<p id=4e3e class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> In theory if we do ship yearly then it should not be problem, like other 'at risk features'</p>
<p id=48ae class=summary>* krisk_ says goodbye to krisk</p>
<p id=9b96 class=irc><cite>&lt;plh&gt;</cite> <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-w3process/2014Mar/0019.html">http://<wbr>lists.w3.org/<wbr>Archives/<wbr>Public/<wbr>public-w3process/<wbr>2014Mar/<wbr>0019.html</a></p>
<p id=e612 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> that is my point, maybe do a paln 2016</p>
<p id=91db class=irc><cite>&lt;rubys&gt;</cite> d/plan/plan/</p>
<p id=ef42 class="phone s07"><cite>plh:</cite> we can use new process if we are not in last call...<br>
<span id=592b>… if you are in last call then you can't use the new process</span></p>
<p id=c4a7 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> the only spec that this could impact I *think* is EME</p>
<p id=ba9d class=irc><cite>&lt;Zakim&gt;</cite> tantek, you wanted to ask why are people considering &quot;5.1 timeframe&quot; for new features? not a good framing. new specs/features should go in extension specs which have their own timelines.</p>
<p id=18c8 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> I was confused about extension specs and 5.1</p>
<p id=fcdf class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> you should read the ally TF work</p>
<p id=1351 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> I think they are really looking at 5.0 in 2014 and then 5.1 2016</p>
<p id=7082 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> I'm all for lining up to other schedules, though it goes against the spirt of extension specs</p>
<p id=88e0 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> The api mapping document pre-dates the concept of extension specs</p>
<p id=10003 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> Their is a very human aspect to this...<br>
<span id=eb83>… other people want to work with us and we should reach out</span><br>
<span id=d0fa>… I think the main purpose of this discusion was to get an idea on the schedule - 2016 may not make sense, or that we can get some agreement about moving to a new yearly schedule</span><br>
<span id=af76>… which will lead to a set of action items where stuff can land  - 5.1, 5.2 etc..</span></p>
<p id=37da class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> did your point get covered?</p>
<p id=73f2 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> I think so and it's matter of communicating and moving forward</p>
<p id=eae9 class="phone s23"><cite>marks:</cite> This really is not an extension spec, it's a series of documents one of which involves HTML, with a core spec published by PF,</p>
<p id=ff52 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> I'm trying to decouple the labels - 5.1, 5.2, 5.005 and focus on the date</p>
<p id=831f class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> when we revist at risk features tomorrow we should leverage this as well</p>
<p id=f930 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> Do you think the json spec would rolled in or stay seperate</p>
<p id=710a class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> If a feature doesn't need to be in the main spec, especially if it has no other dependancies</p>
<p id=e56f class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> so with JSON it should be seperate</p>
<p id=1c46 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> The next item in topic is ally wishlist</p>
<p id=b206 class=summary><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/HTML/wiki/51wishlist">http://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>WAI/<wbr>PF/<wbr>HTML/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>51wishlist</a></p>
<p id=e68f class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> I think we need to talk about the content editable and the 5.1 timeframe</p>
<p id=0528 class=summary>* br vs div vs p tag?</p>
<p id=4ff5 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> OK we can get 15 to talk about tomorrow</p>
<p id=dac5 class=irc><cite>&lt;adrianba&gt;</cite> Extensible Web Summit home page: <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/extensible-web-summit/">http://<wbr>lanyrd.com/<wbr>2014/<wbr>extensible-web-summit/</a></p>
<p id=b839 class="phone s07"><cite>plh:</cite> some are not part of HTML</p>
<p id=0c45 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> having more details (use case) would be very helpful...not picking oh Haptic output,<br>
<span id=2d06>… it's just that it doesn't have info on what exists today and where it fails, etc..</span></p>
<p id=c839 class="phone s26"><cite>cynthia:</cite> menu has issue(s)</p>
<p id=5cf1 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> details and summary are just missing implementations</p>
<p id=32f2 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> yes it's not about the spec, or if we have tests, just not enough implementation</p>
<p id=7ce9 class="phone s23"><cite>marks:</cite> This is not a complete list and indeed needs more refinement</p>
<p id=2957 class="phone s26"><cite>cynthia:</cite> content editable has accessibility issue</p>
<p id=8fb0 class="phone s07"><cite>plh:</cite> yes content editable needs work</p>
<p id=da1a class="phone s23"><cite>marks:</cite> I'll update the wish list with some details and use cases</p>
<p id=2348 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> thanks</p>

<h3 id=c997>Datetime input timezone issues</h3>
<p id=bbd6 class=summary>travil won't be able to discuss due to being on vacation (previously planned)</p>
<p id=21b7 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> Is this about 5.0?</p>
<p id=5a06 class=summary>bug 16597</p>
<p id=00ce class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> has this been fixed in 5.0?</p>
<p id=c71b class=irc><cite>&lt;paulc_&gt;</cite> <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=16957">https://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>Bugs/<wbr>Public/<wbr>show_bug.cgi?id=16957</a></p>
<p id=85e8 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> yes it has been moved to 5.0</p>
<p id=4e9c class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> note the keyword 'CR' - it means it was fixed in the 5.0 CR</p>
<p id=4d70 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> What is health warning?</p>
<p id=3a36 class=irc><cite>&lt;paulc_&gt;</cite> See <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=16957#c6">https://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>Bugs/<wbr>Public/<wbr>show_bug.cgi?id=16957#c6</a> for Travis's comment about resolving this in 5.0</p>
<p id=7ea8 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> Basically is you use this input you might mess up...it's not normative</p>
<p id=2de2 class=summary>next bug is 16959</p>
<p id=21a5 class=irc><cite>&lt;paulc_&gt;</cite> <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=16959">https://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>Bugs/<wbr>Public/<wbr>show_bug.cgi?id=16959</a></p>
<p id=83ee class=summary>* I was about to paste that in paul :)</p>
<p id=8b9f class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> Is this in 5.0?</p>
<p id=9783 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> Me too since it had the CR removed</p>
<p id=31fc class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> why is it still open, it looks like the change was made and intl is happy?</p>
<p id=ac8b class="phone s27"><cite>edoyle:</cite> Kept open since it was part of the F2F</p>
<p id=6a89 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> It raised the flag since it seems to have diverged?</p>
<p id=2e7f class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> maybe not an issue if it has not been implemented</p>
<p id=2ecf class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> what is the current status of datetime input types with this bug</p>
<p id=4462 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> Whatever the path is forward drop datetime-local, or has same functionality as datetime gets in back in sync</p>
<p id=176e class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> since this bug was just fixed, but was last talked about in june 2013</p>
<p id=54bb class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> is the simple issue just change local to floating?</p>
<p id=dc9b class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> seems like this is confusing enough to drop for 5.0</p>
<p id=9741 class="phone s24"><cite>darobin:</cite> Only pre-blink Opera has support for input type=datetime</p>
<p id=aad2 class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> Then indeed we should remove from 5.0</p>
<p id=a433 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> this is on the at risk list already</p>
<p id=9fd1 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> yes we will discuss tomorrow</p>
<p id=d121 class="phone s19"><cite>paulc:</cite> darobin can you do quick check what changes have been made?</p>
<p id=25cc class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> The bug(s) has links to the diffs</p>
<p id=24d0 class="phone s20"><cite>rubys:</cite> No real reason to worry about these bugs since indeed the whole section is at risk to be removed</p>
<p id=6dad class="phone s08"><cite>tantek:</cite> The other reason was that it touches on two items...</p>
<p id=10004 class=summary>one if this was actually well implemented we would have a big issue<br>
<span id=a7b5>… it raises the issue of new features that have no implemetations</span><br>
<span id=8a28>… it could be that the idea is bad and the group could propose a different solution</span><br>
<span id=7300>… for example a extentsion spec that gets implementations</span></p>

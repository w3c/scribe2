<p id=b165 class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> Draft proposal for techniques for dynamic content</p>
<p id=ef57 class="phone s02"><cite>Joshue:</cite> This goes beyond SCR 21</p>
<p id=0e00 class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> goes through comments in survey with users</p>
<p id=b0b6 class="phone s02"><cite>Joshue:</cite> People are using libraies these days... don't now how to address that in our techniques</p>
<p id=4589 class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> JQUERY is used but we can't rely on it...</p>
<p id=5107 class=irc><cite>&lt;AWK&gt;</cite> Original comment that kicked this off: <a href="https://www.w3.org/2006/02/lc-comments-tracker/35422/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20140107/2891">https://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>2006/<wbr>02/<wbr>lc-comments-tracker/<wbr>35422/<wbr>WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20140107/<wbr>2891</a></p>
<p id=0f73 class="phone s03"><cite>Loretta:</cite> We shouldn't stand behind a library.. don't endorse anything</p>
<p id=5c2e class=summary>test</p>
<p id=ffff class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMcD: It's a difficult question, I hear what Josh is saying about real world development.</p>
<p id=35c1 class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMcD: We do want to make sure what we put in works.</p>
<p id=6ff9 class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMcD: If we did identify widgets that worked well in JQuery for example, what would be the harm? We link to other resources like Juicy Studio etc.</p>
<p id=6db8 class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMcD: We do need to acknowledge if people are doing things right.</p>
<p id=565a class="phone s03"><cite>Loretta:</cite> I have nightmare of GOV of Canada or otherw saying, you must you foo library</p>
<p id=9368 class="phone s04"><cite>David:</cite> Yes it is a real concern</p>
<p id=0088 class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> Original comment was form Wilco... we should address applicability of SCR 21, limit it to that now...</p>
<p id=8d17 class="phone s05"><cite>Josh:</cite> Yes let's limit to SCR 21</p>
<p id=6c9f class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/SCR21">http://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>TR/<wbr>WCAG20-TECHS/<wbr>SCR21</a></p>
<p id=3678 class="phone s05"><cite>Josh:</cite> Should we retire it</p>
<p id=7269 class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> Wilco doen't think it aplies to 1.3.1 but it might apply to others such as meaningful sequence</p>
<p id=b266 class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> it is so braod of a way of using technology, that is cannot be made consise?</p>
<p id=d96c class="phone s05"><cite>Josh:</cite> </p>
<p id=933d class=summary>it could be a simpler techniue to cut down, and perhaps expand out to other applicability</p>
<p id=2adb class="phone s04"><cite>David:</cite> GOV of Canada called me up and said document.write should not be discouraged</p>
<p id=3191 class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> seems to discourage some practises rather than encouraging good practises</p>
<p id=7da3 class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> example hard to map to 1.3.1</p>
<p id=a09e class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> if it was titled how to insert a heading into a oage maybe that work</p>
<p id=5334 class="phone s05"><cite>Josh:</cite> yes agree, title of technique not accurate</p>
<p id=7a3f class=irc><cite>&lt;Loretta&gt;</cite> Someone might check with Cynthia Shelly on the history of this technique.</p>
<p id=10000 class="phone s05"><cite>Josh:</cite> turning down volume on the don't in the technique could make it a lot more useful</p>
<p id=213b class="phone s05"><cite>Josh:</cite> can't we map to a conformance requirement</p>
<p id=8d2a class=irc><cite>&lt;David&gt;</cite> s/josh/john</p>
<p id=7441 class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMacD: I don't think we have ever mapped to a conformance requirement</p>
<p id=8d8f class="phone s03"><cite>LORETTA:</cite> We could map to a conformance criteria</p>
<p id=6783 class="phone s03"><cite>Loretta:</cite> with this mapping to 4.1.1 is that you run risk of things like duplicate ids</p>
<p id=6de4 class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> Josh to ping Cynthia for some background on SCR21</p>

<p id=abcc class="phone s06"><cite>Gregg:</cite> We try to talk about positives, but you can talk in a positive way about things to avoid... so you could say, &quot;this is done in this way to avoid that.... but we usually try to say why</p>
<p id=9289 class=irc><cite>&lt;AWK&gt;</cite> Techniques that refer to conformance requirements only currently for <a href="https://github.com/w3c/CR/issues/1">CR#1</a>: <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/20140408/#conformance-reqs">http://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>WAI/<wbr>WCAG20/<wbr>quickref/<wbr>20140408/#conformance-reqs</a></p>
<p id=ecdc class="phone s06"><cite>Gregg:</cite> wrt to wuestion about mapping to conformance criteria... usually it is in conjunction with a SC, but the things that are required are using SC within the conformance criteria, i think we can refer to them but we try tl map to a SC because the Conformance criteria are on the SCs</p>
<p id=2fdd class="phone s05"><cite>JOSH:</cite> +1 on AWK ... rewrite description, new title, relating to example with Form validation would be better</p>

<p id=2b77 class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> wary to map to 4.1.1 but could write failure techniques on messing up dom</p>
<p id=d3b0 class="phone s05"><cite>JOSH:</cite> scr21 doesn't say why it is wrong to do the things it discourages</p>

<p id=bcab class="phone s08"><cite>John:</cite> put a tech support... 3rd paragraph explains why it was an issue prior to JAWS 8</p>
<p id=7539 class=summary>the last few sentence about previous issue... requiring refresh</p>
<p id=a38e class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMacD: General Techs tend to get ignored.</p>
<p id=fa9f class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMacD: They don't have the same profile. What do we do?</p>
<p id=7dcb class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> Yes we should work with EO on that</p>
<p id=434e class=resolution><strong>RESOLUTION:</strong> Accepted as proposed LC 2887</p>

<section>
<h3 id=3b68>Comment LC-2892: Draft response</h3>
<p id=c351 class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> second option is generally accepted.... We could remove the technique</p>
<p id=10001 class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMacD: But isn't it important to notify people of changes to the DOM?</p>
<p id=fb91 class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> &lt;gives example&gt;</p>
<p id=5715 class=irc><cite>&lt;AWK&gt;</cite> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/F76.html">http://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>TR/<wbr>WCAG20-TECHS/<wbr>F76.html</a></p>
<p id=7f49 class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> AWK: This is about changing the users context.</p>
<p id=95e0 class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMacD: But shouldn't it be required? Shouldn't we have a failure where they don't provide instructions for DOM changes?</p>
<p id=2a4a class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> AWK: The only thing thats different here is the notion of where the user location is.</p>
<p id=ac93 class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> AWK: Where can you put this, where it's not at a location that may be bypassed?</p>
<p id=ae1a class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMacD: What about ARIA?</p>
<p id=483d class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> AWK: Sure, but that's a different technique.</p>
<p id=2755 class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMacD: I'd like to think this over.</p>
<p id=1b33 class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> AWK: This isn't about DOM changes, but changes in context.</p>
<p id=0b85 class="phone s08"><cite>JOHN:</cite> would like to have a failure for this DOM... rather have it more general than not at all</p>
<p id=d7c4 class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> if success criteria says it do we need a failure</p>
<p id=11d8 class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> my gut is we could leave it ope, or remove it for now, and come back faiure techniques</p>
<p id=ff6c class="phone s05"><cite>JOSH:</cite> should remove it</p>
<p id=3b71 class="phone s09"><cite>Jon:</cite> agree part of the title is not great... but if we remove failure we loose the test steps</p>
<p id=d1c7 class="phone s09"><cite>JON:</cite> if we remove this are there any failures with test steps</p>
<p id=d81a class="phone s05"><cite>JOSH:</cite> i don't find test steps useful</p>
<p id=f0bf class="phone s09"><cite>JON:</cite> my preference would be to improve test steps</p>
<p id=6c21 class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMacD: Sounds like we need a larger strategy.</p>
<p id=4c67 class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMacD: We need to review the way people are doing things now.</p>
<p id=058a class="phone s09"><cite>JON:</cite> might be able with describedby to modify... maybe reinstate...</p>
<p id=e1d5 class="phone s09"><cite>JON:</cite> would it be the same name or number</p>
<p id=f5e4 class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> depends</p>
<p id=c8fe class="phone s09"><cite>JON:</cite> must weigh danger of leaving it with the what we lose if removed</p>
<p id=1c4e class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> Concerned it has a lot of problems</p>
<p id=9eac class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> David and JON to look at rewriting technique in communication with AWK</p>
<p id=729f class=bot><cite>&lt;trackbot&gt;</cite> 'David' is an ambiguous username. Please try a different identifier, such as family name or username (e.g., dmacdona, dtodd2).</p>
<p id=d70f class="phone s07"><cite>JAMES:</cite> may need mandatory training... should be allowed to replace it</p>
<p id=3a26 class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> leqve open until May 15, pending action by David and JON, but if we don't we will yank...</p>
<p id=5a09 class=resolution><strong>RESOLUTION:</strong> dmacdona and JON to work on rewriting technique.... if done before May 15  it will be considered... if not drop it.</p>
